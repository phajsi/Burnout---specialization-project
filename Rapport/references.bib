	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this empirical study is to explore the drivers and effects of a multidimensional conceptualization of burnout for information technology (IT) personnel using the job demands-resources framework. Design/methodology/approach Using survey data from 247 IT professionals, the authors analyzed our model using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), a composite-based method. Findings The authors find that job demands and job resources differently influence the dimensions of burnout, and the burnout dimensions influenced turnover intention (leave the organization) and turnaway intention (leave the field) except for cynicism, which did not affect turnover intention. The authors’ findings suggest that managers and human resource professionals may want to look beyond managing work exhaustion and consider focusing on the professional efficacy dimension of burnout to keep their IT professionals from leaving the organization and the IT industry. Originality/value This study highlights the need for researchers in the information systems field to rethink using exhaustion as a proxy for the burnout construct as focusing on work exhaustion does not tell the full story for IT professionals. Additionally, the findings indicate that job-related burnout affects not only IT professional's turnover intention but also turnaway intention. Last, psychosocial mentoring did not directly influence any of the burnout components but indirectly influenced all three components.},

	abstract = {Teaching socio-emotional skills among primary school students is the key to creating a climate of cooperation in classrooms and reducing disruptive or aggressive behaviors among students. The primary goal of this research is to present an educational proposal for imparting socio-emotional competencies among primary school students. We attempt to impart socio-emotional competencies based on: (1) fostering self-knowledge, self-esteem, and respect for others among students; (2) developing behaviors that allow them to perceive and express feelings and self-regulating emotions; and (3) developing assertive communication skills aimed at improving conflict resolution. This program has been designed in such a way that it is implemented throughout the academic year by organizing bi-monthly sessions of 45 min each, held until the completion of 15 sessions. The sample consists of 100 students in the third grade, with the control and experimental groups having an equal number of students (50 each). The instruments used for this research are: (a) BarOn Emotional Quotient Inventory (Youth Version [BarOn EQ-i:YV]): used for measuring emotional and social functioning; (b) the Matson Evaluation of Social Skills with Youngsters (MESSY): used for assessing social skills; and (c) Questionnaire for the Assessment of School Violence in Preschool and Primary School Questionnaire. To check the effectiveness of the educational intervention, a quasi-experimental design, along with pretest-posttest control group design, is used in accordance with the general linear model. Its effectiveness is also checked using repeated measures analysis of variance. The results show that the program is useful in preventing violent behaviors in the educational field and promoting the development of socio-emotional skills among third grade students. Finally, the applicability of the program to other educational contexts is discussed to enhance students' personal development and decrease the levels of violence found in primary school.},

Stress management techniques have appeared to be beneficial for the development or enhancement of stress coping skills. The aim of this pilot randomised controlled trial was to assess the effect of a 12-week intervention, comprising training in diaphragmatic breathing and progressive muscular relaxation, on elementary school students’ stress levels. Outcomes on the quality of life and behavioural aspects of the students were also assessed. Standardised questionnaires were administered at baseline and after the 12-week intervention program. Fifty-two children aged 10 to 11 years were randomly assigned to intervention (n=24) and control groups (n=28). Children of the intervention group demonstrated lower levels of stress (in all three subscales of lack of well-being, distress, and lack of social support) and improved aspects of quality of life (physical, emotional, and school functioning). No significant differences were observed regarding the examined behavioural dimensions, in the intervention group. Larger randomised controlled trials with follow-up evaluations are needed to ascertain the positive outcomes of such programs on elementary school children.},

	abstract = {Objective: Providing resources and stress management techniques is vital to the improvement of mental health outcomes of deploying warfighters. Despite the large amount of resources available, they are largely ineffective owing in part to lack of familiarity and knowledge of the resources themselves. This may be ameliorated through game-based practice environments. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a serious game to teach deploying military personnel about available mental health resources and coping skills, as well as to determine whether the inclusion of minigames improved learning outcomes.

Materials and Methods: Participants played the serious game “Walk in My Shoes” (Novonics Corp., Orlando, FL) to learn about mental health resources and coping skills. Half of the participants applied this knowledge during the game by playing minigames, whereas the other half played minigames featuring irrelevant content. This study was conducted both in-person and online.

Results: Participants who practiced the content by playing relevant minigames had positive learning gains, whereas those who played minigames with irrelevant content did not improve from baseline. There were no differences with respect to whether the game was played in the laboratory or in a more naturalistic environment.

Conclusions: Web-based serious games can be effective in providing information about resources and skills to deploying warfighters. Including minigames to provide practice in a game-based training environment such as a serious game improves learning outcomes. Such a serious game, regardless of the inclusion of minigames, also increases self-reports of deployment self-efficacy.},

	title = {A virtual reality serious videogame versus online chess augmentation in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: {A} randomized clinical trial},
	volume = {10},
	abstract = {Objective: Serious videogames and virtual reality (VR) have gained increasing interest for treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). “The Secret Trail of Moon” (TSTM) study is a clinical trial devoted to testing the efficacy of TSTM, a VR serious videogame developed to train in five major cognitive skills usually compromised in patients with ADHD. This study is a three-arm nonequality trial comparing TSTM to online chess training and a control group (CG). This study aims to demonstrate that augmentation with either TSTM or online chess is efficacious in clinically drug-stable patients with ADHD.

Materials and Methods: This study is prospective, unicentric, and randomized with a CG. One hundred five patients with ADHD, ages 12–22 years old, and pharmacologically stable were enrolled. Patients were randomized into three groups: TSTM group, online chess group (therapeutic chess [TC]), and CG. Objective and subjective measures of the patient and parents are included. Patient visits differ for each group. TSTM group patients have 15 face-to-face visits: preinclusion visit, inclusion visit, 12 training visits, and final visit. TC and CG patients have 3 face-to-face visits (preinclusion, initial visit, and final visit) and 12 e-mail or phone communications during training (TC) or follow-up (CG group). This study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board (IRB).

Results: Not applicable. This is a study protocol.

Conclusion: This is the first study testing an augmentation strategy using either a serious videogame or chess in clinically drug-treated patients with ADHD. Using VR serious videogames present with several advantages over traditional videogames.},

Five semi-structured interviews were conducted in which participants from different cultural backgrounds shared their thoughts and feelings about video gaming experiences. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis, which identified five themes along with their subthemes. The results showed that the participants experienced a wide range of feelings during the game, which led to a better understanding of the emotion-focused and avoidance coping strategies used in games. Participants recognized that games include problem-solving scenarios and outlined their problem-solving strategies. The study found that participants applied in-game strategies extensively to their real-life situations, and, moreover, because of gaming, they coped well with lockdowns. The results of the current study have expanded knowledge about videogaming experience and filled a knowledge gap on the use of in-game strategies in real life, which has contributed to the research of this topic.},

	abstract = {Autistic girls, who are diagnosed less frequently than boys and are often able to blend into their social environment while obscuring autistic behaviours, often face difficulties interacting and integrating with their social environment and become marginalized by their peers. In recent years, applied games (also "serious games") have gained popularity as a tool to support young autistic people in their socio-emotional development. This study investigates how we can design an applied computer game to support autistic girls (10-16y.) by providing a safe environment to experience simulated social interactions and learn how to cope with conflict and emotions. The project employed a user-centric approach by involving autistic girls, experts and practitioners during the design process. The two main outcomes are a proposal for a game design and playable game prototype, as well as insights on the active involvement of autistic girls as game co-designers.},

Building on existing studies and mobile apps supporting stress coping, we propose the design of a mobile coping assistant that uses multimodal sensor data to reduce its user’s stress. Based on sensor data, a mobile coping assistant (1) warns the user about elevated stress, (2) delivers a fundamental understanding of why they are currently stressed, (3) recommends targeted coping strategies to encourage and train effective coping behavior, and (4) executes automated actions to reduce stress exposure. The presented design comprises an architecture, good practices for designing the architectural components, and an algorithm for selecting adequate coping actions and recommendations. A prototypical instantiation indicates opportunities and challenges. Future research should evaluate the short- and long-term effectiveness of mobile coping assistants in the field.},

	title = {A framework and serious game for decision making in stressful situations; a fire evacuation scenario},
	volume = {162},
	abstract = {Decision making is a core cognitive process of human behaviour that is often affected by stress. Whilst we make several decisions on a daily basis, firefighters in particular are called to make important decisions in a split
second and within life-threatening settings. Stress can therefore impact their ability to perform and carry out
their job. The implications of stress are similarly important in other settings requiring high-vigilance. In this
paper, we aim to contribute to efforts to better train firefighters in decision making in stressful situations through
a serious game solution. The game was designed based on the Stress Exposure Training (SET) approach and in
accordance with typical stressors identified in the literature. Those were then mapped to relevant game me-
chanics. The evaluation of the resulting game was twofold: A. to assess its ability to increase participants’ stress
level, and B. to investigate whether decision making performance would be improved for participants under
stress. The proposed framework and the prototype were evaluated through empirical research that consisted of
the participants’ self-reported stress levels using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI) and the
participants’ physiological measurements, namely galvanic skin response (GSR) and heart rate (HR). Our results
demonstrate the potential of serious games to assist towards training of firefighters to make better decisions
under stressful situations. Our findings are of wider importance as they contribute to ongoing efforts to improve decision making under stress in a variety of settings and scenarios.},

	abstract = {Objective
Being a healthcare professional can be a uniquely rewarding calling. However, the demands of training and practice can lead to chronic distress and serious psychological, interpersonal and personal-health burdens. Although higher burnout, depression and suicide rates have been reported in healthcare professionals, only a minority receives treatment. Concerns regarding confidentiality, stigma, potential career implications, and cost and time constraints are cited as key barriers. Web-based and mobile applications have been shown to mitigate stress, burnout, depression, and suicidal ideation among several populations and may circumvent these barriers. Here, we reviewed published data on such resources and selected a small sample that readily can be used by healthcare providers.

Methods
We searched PubMed for articles evaluating stress, burnout, depression and suicide prevention or intervention for healthcare students or providers and identified 5 categories of programs with significant effectiveness: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (online), meditation, mindfulness, breathing, and relaxation techniques. Using these categories, we searched for stress-, burnout-, depression-, and suicide prevention- web-based (through Google and beacon.anu.edu.au--a wellness resource website) and mobile applications (Apple and mobile.va.gov/appstore) and identified 36 resources to further evaluate based on relevance, applicability to healthcare providers (confidentiality, convenience and cost) and the strength of findings supporting their effectiveness.

Results
We selected 7 resources under 5 general categories designed to foster wellness and reduce burnout, depression, and suicide risk among healthcare workers: breathing (Breath2Relax), meditation (Headspace, guided meditation audios), web-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MoodGYM, Stress Gym) and suicide prevention apps (Stay Alive, Virtual Hope Box).

Conclusions
This list serves as a starting point to enhance coping with stressors as a healthcare student or professional in order to help mitigate burnout, depression and suicidality. Next steps include adapting digital health strategies to specifically fit the needs of healthcare providers, with the ultimate goal of facilitating in-person care when warranted.},

An overview of empirical findings reveals the importance of chronic stressors in the job environment, as well as costly personal and organizational outcomes. Furthermore, there is a significant theme in the burnout experience, of imbalance between demands and resources, and between the job and the individual worker.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.burn.2015.05.001},
	abstract = {Background/aim
Occupational health largely depends on the perceived fit between the employee's abilities and workplace demands/factors. The Areas of Worklife Scale (AWS) specifies six areas that are particularly relevant in this respect: workload, control, reward, community, fairness, and values. The current article aimed at investigating the factorial structure and the criterion validity of the German translation of the AWS.
Methods
Data were collected in two samples. In study 1, 1455 public service workers were surveyed using the six areas of worklife and well-being. In study 2, to investigate the well-established relationship between the AWS and burnout, the scale was administered to a nursing sample (N=443).
Results
High internal consistencies for all six scales were obtained in both studies. Exploratory as well as confirmatory factor analysis replicated the theoretically assumed six scale structure of the AWS. Evidence of criterion validity was found by multiple linear regression analysis with well-being as dependent measure (study 1). SEM analyses supported the hypothesized relationships between the six AWS dimensions and burnout (study 2). As predicted by Leiter and Maslach, 2004, Leiter and Maslach, 2009, only some areas were directly associated with the health-related outcomes (well-being and burnout). In line with previous work, workload and values proved to be the most critical areas of worklife.
Conclusions
The six areas of worklife have been shown to be significant predictors of health-related outcomes. Based on the current studies, the German translation of the AWS can be proposed as a reliable and valid instrument to identify and specify critical work-related areas for occupational health.},
