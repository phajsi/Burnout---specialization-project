	abstract = {Raw and processed (soaked or cooked) seeds of peas, lentils, chickpeas, fava beans and common beans were studied for their contents of antinutritional factors (lectins, phytic acid, total and soluble oxalates), along with soybean as a control. Analysis of variance indicated that legume type, treatment and their interactive effects were significant on these antinutrients. The raw soybean seed was found to contain the highest levels of lectins (692.8 HU/mg), phytic acid (22.91 mg/g), total oxalate (370.5 mg/100 g) and soluble oxalate (200.7 mg/100 g) among all investigated seeds. Relatively high contents of lectins were detected in beans (87.69–88.59 HU/mg) and other pulses ranging from 2.73–11.07 HU/mg. Phytic acid in Canadian pulses varied slightly from 8.55–22.85 mg/g. Total oxalates were variable, ranging from 244.7–294.0 mg/100 g in peas, 168.6–289.1 mg/100 g in lentils, 241.5–291.4 mg/100 g in fava beans, 92.2–214.0 mg/100 g in chickpeas and 98.86–117.0 mg/100 g in common beans. Approximately 24–72\% of total oxalate appeared to be soluble in all investigated pulses. Soaking the seeds in distilled water significantly decreased the contents of lectins (0.11–5.18\%), total oxalate (17.40–51.89\%) and soluble oxalate (26.66–56.29\%), but had no impact on phytic acid. The cooking process was found to be more effective in reducing levels of all the investigated antinutritional factors, except phytic acid in common beans and soybean.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: The soluble complexes formed between hydrolyzed soybean protein and calcium at pH 7.4 were investigated using dialysis, gel chromatography, and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR). The results demonstrate that the amount of calcium bound was significantly different for soybean protein hydrolysates obtained using the proteases neutrase, flavourzyme, protease M, and pepsin. Maximum levels of calcium binding (66.9 mg/g) occurred with hydrolysates produced using protease M. Peptide fragments exhibiting high calcium binding capacity had molecular weights of either 14.4 kDa or 8 to 9 kDa, and the calcium binding capacity was linearly correlated with carboxyl group content (R2= 0.8204). FTIR experiments revealed that upon binding calcium, the amide I band underwent a shift to lower wave numbers. A wide, intense Ca–O absorption band also appeared between 400 and 100 cm−1 in the far-infrared spectrum. The width and intensity of this band increased after treatment of samples with glutaminase. The amount of bound calcium was related to both the molecular weight of the peptides and to the carboxyl group content, and the most likely sites for calcium binding are the carboxyl groups of Asp and Glu.},

	abstract = {Hydrocolloids are among the most widely used ingredients in the food industry. They function as thickening and gelling agents, texturizers, stabilisers and emulsifiers and in addition have application in areas such as edible coatings and flavour release. Products reformulated for fat reduction are particularly dependent on hydrocolloids for satisfactory sensory quality. They now also find increasing applications in the health area as dietary fibre of low calorific value. The first edition of Handbook of Hydrocolloids provided professionals in the food industry with relevant practical information about the range of hydrocolloid ingredients readily and at the same time authoritatively. It was exceptionally well received and has subsequently been used as the substantive reference on these food ingredients. Extensively revised and expanded and containing eight new chapters, this major new edition strengthens that reputation. Edited by two leading international authorities in the field, the second edition reviews over twenty-five hydrocolloids, covering structure and properties, processing, functionality, applications and regulatory status. Since there is now greater emphasis on the protein hydrocolloids, new chapters on vegetable proteins and egg protein have been added. Coverage of microbial polysaccharides has also been increased and the developing role of the exudate gums recognised, with a new chapter on Gum Ghatti. Protein-polysaccharide complexes are finding increased application in food products and a new chapter on this topic as been added. Two additional chapters reviewing the role of hydrocolloids in emulsification and their role as dietary fibre and subsequent health benefits are also included. The second edition of Handbook of hydrocolloids is an essential reference for post-graduate students, research scientists and food manufacturers.Extensively revised and expanded second edition edited by two leading international authoritiesProvides an introduction to food hydrocolliods considering regulatory aspects and thickening characteristicsComprehensively examines the manufacture, structure, function and applications of over twenty five hydrocolloids},

	abstract = {Epidermal growth factors (EGF) serve as promising candidates for skin regeneration and rejuvenation products, but their instability hinders them from widespread use. Protective immobilization and directed release can be achieved through implementing a hydrogel delivery system. Alginate and methylcellulose are both natural polymers offering biocompatibility and environmental sensitivity. This blended gel system was investigated rheologically to understand its performance in topical applications. Alginate and methylcellulose were found to form a synergistic gel system that resulted in superior viscosity and thermoresponsiveness compared to the individual components. Increasing methylcellulose concentration directly enhanced gel elasticity, and higher viscosities provided better thermal protection of EGF. The addition of EGF at 3.33 mg/mL resulted in a decrease of viscosity but an increase in viscoelastic modulus. EGF concentration also played a large role in shear viscosity and thermoresponsiveness of the ternary system. An alginate-methylcellulose system presents promising rheological tunability, which may provide EGF thermal protection in a topical delivery format.},

	abstract = {A novel method using a temperature-sensitive polymer (methylcellulose) to thermally gel aqueous alginate blended with distinct salts (CaCl2, Na2HPO4, or NaCl), as a pH-sensitive hydrogel was developed for protein drug delivery. It was noted that the salts blended in hydrogels may affect the structures of an entangled network of methylcellulose and alginate and have an effect on their swelling characteristics. The methylcellulose/alginate hydrogel blended with 0.7 M NaCl (with a gelation temperature of 32 °C) demonstrated excellent pH sensitivity and was selected for the study of release profiles of a model protein drug (bovine serum albumin, BSA). In the preparation of drug-loaded hydrogels, BSA was well-mixed to the dissolved aqueous methylcellulose/alginate blended with salts at 4 °C and then gelled by elevating the temperature to 37 °C. This drug-loading procedure in aqueous environment at low temperature may minimize degradation of the protein drug while achieving a high loading efficiency (95−98\%). The amount of BSA released from test hydrogels was a function of the amount of alginate used in the hydrogels. The amount of BSA released at pH 1.2 from the test hydrogel with 2.5\% alginate was relatively low (20\%), while that released at pH 7.4 increased significantly (86\%). In conclusion, the methylcellulose/alginate hydrogel blended with NaCl could be a suitable carrier for site-specific protein drug delivery in the intestine.},

	abstract = {Methylcellulose (MC) is widely used as a rheology modifier because, upon heating in aqueous solutions, MC reversibly self-assembles into ∼7–10 nm radius fibrils that percolate into a network, resulting in physical gelation. Here, we have chemically cross-linked both MC solutions at room temperature and MC physical fibril gels at 80 °C and compared the swelling and shear modulus properties of both materials. To achieve this, hydroxyl moieties on MC (Mw ≈ 150 kDa) were substituted with allyl groups, with a degree of substitution of about one pendant carbon–carbon double bond per nine anhydroglucose repeat units. The allyl groups undergo cross-linking in the presence of a photoinitiator and UV light. Chemically cross-linking MC fibril gels (“xfib-MC”) at 80 °C results in opaque solid materials and locks in the fibril structure, which persists even on cooling back to room temperature. From small-angle X-ray scattering analysis, the fibril radius is larger at room temperature ∼20 nm and decreases to ∼10 nm at 80 °C. While the fibrils themselves shrink upon heating, the total volume change of xfib-MC gels is minimal. The dynamic shear modulus G′ increases modestly with increasing temperature despite the lack of volume change, and the volume fraction scaling of the modulus is consistent with previous results for fibril gels. On the other hand, chemically cross-linking MC solutions (“xsol-MC”) at room temperature leads to clear, solid hydrogels, which no longer form fibrils upon heating. Instead, swelling measurements show that the xsol-MC gels shrink by an order of magnitude in volume when the temperature is increased from 25 to 80 °C. The equilibrium polymer volume fraction, ϕe, and G′ are consistent with established theories for cross-linked polymer chains. We conclude that the origin of elasticity at 80 °C for the two solid materials is totally different and highly tunable. For xsol-MC gels, the modulus arises from conformational entropy of the chains, and for xfib-MC gels, the modulus is attributed to the bending modulus of the individual fibrils.},

The present review focus on the different pre and post-harvest factors that influences the ruminant meat flavor. Raw meat has little flavor but cooking adds value in flavor due to different temperature and cooking methods. The volatile flavoring compounds which are responsible for cooked meat flavor are produced thermally by the Maillard’s reaction itself or interaction with lipid oxidation products and vitamin degradation. In nutshell, this review provides perception into previous literature on flavor that affected by various factors particularly the fatty acids and cooking methods.},

Research was carried out on two previously prepared commercial parsnip samples, both fresh and cooked for 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes. Hardness was measured using a TA.XTPlus Texture Analyzer, equipped with different fixtures and load cells. Penetration test was performed on the parsnip discs, while the instrument was equipped with a 5 kg load cell and a 2 mm diameter stainless steel flat cylinder probe. Shearing test was conducted on the whole parsnip roots with a 30 kg load cell and Warner-Bratzler (WB) flat knife blade. The obtained values of the coefficients of variation for both methods indicated that these methods are more suitable for measuring the hardness of fresh parsnip. The results of analysis of variance showed that penetration test generally expressed better differentiation between the samples A and B. The greatest change of firmness during cooking was observed after the first 5 minutes, as measured by both methods. Parsnip firmness progressively decreased with increasing cooking time, with less pronounced differences between the cooking times obtained by shearing test. Further experiments should include more representative parsnip samples and more repetitions within the sample in order to make general conclusions. All results should be verified with sensory evaluation of parsnip hardness by an expert panel or a panel of trained assessors.},

Looking at the research and the available options in the market, there are two generations of products based on typical proteins, such as soy or gluten, and newer generation proteins, such as peas or faba beans, or even proteins based on previously used feed proteins. In the review, we present the characteristics of several proteins that can be consumed as alternatives to first-generation proteins used in vegan foods. In the following part of the work, we describe the research in which novel protein sources were used in terms of the product they are used for. The paper describes protein sources such as cereal proteins, oilseeds proteins coming from the cakes after oil pressing, and novel sources such as algae, insects, and fungus for use in meat analog products. Technological processes that can make non-animal proteins similar to meat are also discussed, as well as the challenges faced by technologists working in the field of vegan products.},

The ubiquitous trend of veganism tied with the increasing apprehensions towards animal welfare, negative impact on human health and the environment has escalated the demand for meat alternatives mainly plant-based meat analogues (PBMA). Protein-rich bioresources such as cereals, vegetables, and algae have been explored to mimic animal meat in a similar flavour, texture, sensory and aromatic properties. This review aims to summarize the recent advancements in functional food technology based on vegetal proteins, a comparative account of traditional and commercially available meat alternates. The literature search for the last 10 years shows the rise in research on plant ingredients to develop novel human foods. A brief account of various production methods and their processing effects to improve the structural and techno-functionality of PBMA is suggested for designing sustainable food. The different combinations of plant and animal proteins are discussed to enhance the nutritional aspect, organoleptic profile and shelf-life of available food products. The positive feedback resulted in booming food industries across the world, incorporating vegetal proteins. The global market trend introducing well-established and promising food brands is listed to discuss the prospects of PBMA.},

	abstract = {Aim: To examine the relation between meat intake and diabetes occurrence in adults. Methods: In a prospective cohort study we examined the relation between diet and incident diabetes recorded among 8,401 cohort members (ages 45-88 years) of the Adventist Mortality Study and Adventist Health Study (California, USA) who were non-diabetic at baseline. During the 17-year follow-up, we identified 543 incident diabetes cases. Results: (1) Subjects who were weekly consumers of all meats were 29\% (OR = 1.29; 95\% CI 1.08, 1.55) more likely (relative to zero meat intake) to develop diabetes. (2) Subjects who consumed any processed meats (salted fish and frankfurters) were 38\% (OR = 1.38; 95\% CI 1.05-1.82) more likely to develop diabetes. (3) Long-term adherence (over a 17-year interval) to a diet that included at least weekly meat intake was associated with a 74\% increase (OR = 1.74; 95\% CI 1.36-2.22) in odds of diabetes relative to long-term adherence to a vegetarian diet (zero meat intake). Further analyses indicated that some of this risk may be attributable to obesity and/or weight gain - both of which were strong risk factors in this cohort. It is noteworthy that even after control for weight and weight change, weekly meat intake remained an important risk factor (OR = 1.38; 95\% CI 1.06-1.08) for diabetes. Conclusions: Our findings raise the possibility that meat intake, particularly processed meats, is a dietary risk factor for diabetes. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

These estimates include the GHG emissions from primary production, international trade and land use change. The share of animal products in the diet is the most important factor determining the footprint of food consumption. Embedded land use change in imports also plays a major role.

	abstract = {During the last decade, the interest on the use of seaweed as food or feed, which was before limited to certain European regional subpopulations, has experienced a significant increase in other regions of the EU. In fact, the growing awareness and interest on sustainable and alternative food sources, healthier lifestyles and changes on dietary patterns brought seaweed to the spotlight for the general worldwide cuisine. Due to their high biosorption and accumulation capacity, seaweed can be an important source of increased exposure to persistent and potential harmful elements, such as cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg) and inorganic arsenic (iAs), or even some micronutrients, particularly iodine (I), to which an antioxidant role as been described in seaweed. This concentration potential has raised the interest of several Food Authorities regarding the risk of increased exposure to these elements. Moreover, the European Commission requested the collection of monitoring data on their levels aiming to aid the performance of better risk assessments and potentially set maximum levels on the European Legislation. This work aimed to obtain levels of these elements in species of seaweed (Fucus vesiculosus, Fucus serratus, Fucus spiralis, Fucus evanescens, Saccharina latissima, ulva lactuca and Ccladophora sp.) cultivated and harvested in Denmark, following European Commission's request. Additionally, a collaboration between Denmark, Ireland, France and the Netherlands was initiated to review and collect all the data available on scientific papers regarding the levels of these contaminants in seaweed worldwide. The final result of this work would be the publication of a review article. This Fellowship also provided on-the-job training on the evaluation of applications of new biocides and participation in the science based advises given to the Danish Food and Veterinary Administration, Danish EPA, the Danish Medical Agency and ECHA.},

	abstract = {The use of cultivated seaweeds as a feedstock for multiple industrial applications has gained increasing interest in the Western World over the past decades. Norway has an extensive coastline and a well-established aquaculture sector offering suitable preconditions for developing large-scale cultivation of seaweed biomass both in monoculture and in Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) systems. Recent efforts from research, industry and public authorities have been committed to develop a Norwegian bio-economy based on cultivated seaweed, focusing on cultivation and processing of the biomass. This review reports on the status of seaweed aquaculture in Norway, supported by production data collected since the delivery of the first commercial cultivation permits at sea in 2014. Although novel product developments are currently limited, future industrial perspectives based on cultivated biomass are being discussed. Upscaling from experimental cultivation schemes to commercial production requires a thorough assessment of the risks and benefits associated with seaweed aquaculture, as well as the development of a regulative framework adapted to this industry. Issues associated with upscaling the macroalgal production that needs to be addressed includes (i) genetic interactions between cultivated and wild crops, (ii) impacts of seaweed cultivation on surrounding ecosystems, (iii) epiphytes and diseases, (iv) area utilization and (v) threats from climate change. Addressing these issues and adapting production practices will ensure the environmental and economic sustainability of an emerging industry based on cultivated seaweed biomass in Norway.},

They function as thickening and gelling agents, texturizers, stabilisers and emulsifiers and in addition have application in areas such as edible coatings and flavour release. Products reformulated for fat reduction are particularly dependent on hydrocolloids for satisfactory sensory quality. They now also find increasing applications in the health area as dietary fibre of low calorific value. The first edition of Handbook of Hydrocolloids provided professionals in the food industry with relevant practical information about the range of hydrocolloid ingredients readily and at the same time authoritatively. It was exceptionally well received and has subsequently been used as the substantive reference on these food ingredients. Extensively revised and expanded and containing eight new chapters, this major new edition strengthens that reputation. Edited by two leading international authorities in the field, the second edition reviews over twenty-five hydrocolloids, covering structure and properties, processing, functionality, applications and regulatory status. Since there is now greater emphasis on the protein hydrocolloids, new chapters on vegetable proteins and egg protein have been added. Coverage of microbial polysaccharides has also been increased and the developing role of the exudate gums recognised, with a new chapter on Gum Ghatti. Protein-polysaccharide complexes are finding increased application in food products and a new chapter on this topic as been added. Two additional chapters reviewing the role of hydrocolloids in emulsification and their role as dietary fibre and subsequent health benefits are also included.

	abstract = {Alginate is a polysaccharide obtained from seaweeds that are abundantly available and have shown great potential for diverse industrial applications. However, alginate lacks properties such as stability under aqueous conditions and it is difficult to control the rate of degradation of alginate-based materials, crucial for various medical applications. Therefore, researchers have modified alginate using physical or chemical approaches to enhance physical properties, biocompatibility, solubility and also to control the biodegradability of alginate-based materials. Crosslinking using ionic, covalent, photo and enzymatic approaches are one of the preferred methods for modifying the properties of alginates and its derivatives. Crosslinking binds the individual polymer chains with one another to form a network that enhances mechanical properties and stability. Among the different crosslinking approaches, ionic crosslinking provides biomaterials with limited stability whereas biomaterials with high mechanical stability can be prepared by covalent crosslinking. Although a wide variety of crosslinking chemicals and approaches are available to make alginate suitable for various applications, the methods used, properties and applications of the cross-linked materials vary significantly between studies. There are very few reports that have compared and evaluated the benefits of using different crosslinking approaches and the properties and applications of cross-linked alginate. In this review, the various methods of crosslinking alginates, their advantages, and limitations have been reviewed with particular emphasis on medical applications of alginate. The data for writing the review was obtained using search engines like Google scholar, Sci-hub and Sci finder and the keywords used include alginate, crosslinking, ionic, covalent, photo, enzymatic, biomedical applications.},

The gelation mechanism of aqueous MC solutions has been debated for many years. However, in 2010, gelation was discovered to be concurrent with fibril formation upon heating, whereby the MC polymer chains self-assemble into fibrils with a remarkably consistent mean diameter, largely independent of polymer concentration, molecular weight, and temperature of gelation. This discovery has shed important light on the gelation mechanism, and initiated studies that lead to more intriguing questions about the fibrils themselves. This review emphasizes various developments since the discovery of fibril formation, while highlighting unanswered questions that require further investigation.},

	abstract = {Thermal gelation was studied for aqueous gelling solutions of a methylcellulose. An attempt was made to elucidate the gel network structure and the validity of scaling laws. Thermal gelation was observed on heating, and it reverted to the liquid state on cooling. The thermoreversibility was a heating/cooling rate dependent process. For isothermally stabilized samples, 42.5 °C was found to be the critical temperature differentiating the weak gels from the strong gels. Below 42.5 °C, the gel elasticity evolved by following a scaling law with temperature as Ge ∼ [(T − Tc)/Tc]2.93 where Ge is the equilibrium modulus of the gel and Tc is the critical temperature of 42.5 °C. In contrast, no single scaling laws could be found for Ge when the temperature was above 42.5 °C. In the temperature range from 42.5 to 70 °C, it was observed that the elasticity evolution was a linear function of temperature and the mean bridge length between junctions was independent of temperature. On the basis of the experimental results, we proposed the gel network structure formed from the methylcellulose, which consists of hydrophobically associating domains as the junctions and the mean chain length of 2.75 × 104 g/mol as bridges connecting the junctions.},

During the extrusion process of TVP, under the comprehensive effects of temperature, shear force, and pressure, complex conformational changes and molecular interactions amongst protein, carbohydrate, lipid, and other components occur, all of which influence the quality of TVP. Control of the extrusion process is still one of the largest challenges in its evolution. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the development and current status of food extrusion technology for TVP production and give detailed descriptions about the conformational changes of the main components during the extrusion process, focusing on the effects of barrel temperature, moisture content, feed rate and screw speed on TVP quality. Lastly, we discuss approaches to characterize the extrusion process and propose a new system analysis model.},

	abstract = {In 1989 the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation recommended the use of the Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) method for evaluating protein quality. In calculating PDCAAS, the limiting amino acid score (i.e., ratio of first limiting amino acid in a gram of target food to that in a reference protein or requirement) is multiplied by protein digestibility. The PDCAAS method has now been in use for 20 years. Research emerging during this time has provided useful data on various aspects of protein quality evaluation that has made a review of the current methods used in assessing protein quality necessary. This paper provides an overview of the use of the PDCAAS method as compared to other methods and addresses some of the key challenges that remain in regards to protein quality evaluation. Furthermore, specific factors influencing protein quality including the effects of processing conditions and preparation methods are presented. Protein quality evaluation methods and recommended protein intakes currently used in different countries vis-à-vis the WHO/FAO/UNU standards are further provided. As foods are frequently consumed in complement with other foods, the significance of the PDCAAS of single protein sources may not be evident, thus, protein quality of some key food groups and challenges surrounding the calculation of the amino acid score for dietary protein mixtures are further discussed. As results from new research emerge, recommendations may need to be updated or revised to maintain relevance of methods used in calculating protein quality.},

Concurrent simple shear deformation and heating (95°C) of the protein blends generated original structures consisting of fibers or layers. The ratio of SPI to vital WG and the final concentration determined the morphology of the structure. It is hypothesized that the spatial distribution of the SPI-rich phase and the WG-rich phase in a blend was altered by the shear flow. When both phases became aligned horizontally in the shear cell, a fibrous structure was formed; when they became aligned vertically in the shear cell, a layered structure was formed. The structures obtained were analyzed visually and using texture analysis and scanning electron microscopy.},

This SPI-WG blend consists of two phases, which are separated on a micrometer scale. The properties, especially the rheological properties, of SPI- and WG-phases determine the structure formation process largely. The objective of this study was to determine the properties of the phases present in SPI-WG blends using conditions relevant for fibrous structure formation. Since, the rheological properties are dependent on the concentration of each protein in its respective phase, we determined the water content in the two phases with a methodology based on time-domain nuclear magnetic resonance. The spatial distribution of the two phases was studied with confocal scanning laser microscopy, and the rheological properties were measured with three types of oscillatory rheology. The experiments showed that the SPI-phase absorbed more water than the WG-phase, which resulted in a larger volume fraction than mass fraction of the SPI-phase and vice versa for WG. The absorption of more water by SPI resulted in a lower concentration of SPI in that phase, remarkably leading to a G′-value for SPI that was similar to the rheological properties of WG. Similarities in rheological properties seem to be required to strongly deform and align the dispersed phase and form fibrous macrostructures.},

These products are gaining popularity due to surging consumer demand for plant-based products as “better for you” and “better for the planet” alternatives. In this frame, this review aimed to provide the current and forthcoming challenges for meat analogues industry by addressing their market growth drivers, formulation, the pros and cons of conventional and innovative processing, safety and healthiness as well as consumers’ perception and acceptance. Despite the significant improvements made in the flavor and texture of plant-based meat analogues, food industries still have difficulties in delivering the right sensory experience and there is increased request for sustainable, nutritious and clean label ingredients. For shaping the future of plant-based meat analogues, the main driver is sustainable nutrition through prompting further improvements in formulation [by enhancing proteins functionally (pre/post-processing) and healthiness (blending plant proteins with tailored nutritional makeup and reducing salt contents)] and processing [by finding solutions to their “processed” and “ultra-processed” nature]. In the future, meat analogue companies will keep pushing the boundaries to mimic meat experience (by improving taste and healthiness) as well as reduce product price and increase product convenience.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate different methods used for estimating cook loss in broiler breast fillets (pectoralis major). Two experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, intact fillets were weighed, cooked to 75°C, and then subjected to 1 of 3 postcook handling treatments: cooling for 5 min at room temperature before reweighing (5-minute), cooling at room temperature until they reached room temperature before reweighing (RT), or cooling in ice water until they reached room temperature before reweighing (IW). In the second experiment, breast fillet portions were used to compare the effects of endpoint temperature (53°C, 57°C, 68°C, 75°C, or 90°C) on cook loss estimation by the 5-minute and RT methods. Breast fillets were collected from local chicken processing plants and trimmed to similar weight prior to cooking. Cook loss, cook loss retention, and total cook loss after 24 h in cooked fillets were measured for comparisons. Data showed that cook loss ({\textless}17\%) and total loss (19.3\%) estimated with the IW method were lower (P {\textless} 0.05) than those with the 5-minute and RT methods (19–21\% for cook loss and 21.1–21.3\% for total loss), which did not differ from each other. When the endpoint temperature was ≥75°C, no differences in cook loss estimates or moisture loss were noted between the 5 min and RT methods (after 3 h cooling). However, when the temperatures were 53°C to 75°C, cook loss estimations were significantly different (P {\textless} 0.05) between the 5 min and RT methods (more than 4\%). Reduced endpoint temperature resulted in increasing differences (from less than 5\% to more than 9\%) in cook loss estimates. These results demonstrate that endpoint cooking temperature and postcooking sample handling methods may affect cook loss estimates in broiler breast meat.},

Thermal treatments induced water loss (P{\textless}0.001), being lower in foal steaks cooked in the grill (25.8\%) and higher in foal samples cooked in the microwave (39.5\%). As it was expected, all the cooking methods increased TBARS index, since high temperature during cooking seems to cause an increase of the lipid oxidation in foal steaks. Statistical analysis displayed that WHC was affected (P{\textless}0.001) by thermal treatment, since the smallest WHC values were observed in samples from microwave treatment.

Polymers that were studied included Sodium Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), Methylcellulose (MC), Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) and Sodium Alginate (ALG). The effects of polymer concentration, temperature and autoclaving on solution viscosity were determined. With all the polymers, viscosity/ concentration relationships were linearized by using an equation of the type mu = (Ca + beta)gamma, where mu and C referred to solution viscosity and concentration, respectively. alpha and gamma were constants related to polymer type and molecular weight, whereas beta reflected viscosity of water at the temperature of measurement. gamma, which reflects the sensitivity of the viscosity/concentration relationship, was determined to be 4 for both low and high molecular weight CMC and ALG, and 8 for MC and HPMC. alpha, on the other hand, was directly proportional to polymer molecular weight. The same equation could also adequately describe viscosity/temperature relationships for each polymer. For both CMC and ALG, increasing solution concentration had a greater effect on the reduction of viscosity upon increasing temperature. A concentration dependent thermal "gelation" phenomena was observed with MC solutions. Autoclaving effects were more pronounced in ALG solutions as compared to CMC samples in the 0.5 to 3.0\% w/v concentration range. No significant long term effects on solution viscosity were observed with MC and HPMC, however.},

Alginates are linear anionic polysaccharides composed of 1,4-linked β-d-mannuronate (M) and α-l-guluronate (G) residues. The impact of M and G contents and pH is investigated to correlate with the formation and size of β-Lg alginate complexes under relevant ionic strength. It is concluded, using three alginates of M/G ratios 0.6, 1.1, and 1.8 and similar molecular mass, that β-Lg binding capacity is higher at pH 4.0 than at pH 2.65 and for high M content. By contrast, the largest particles are obtained at pH 2.65 and with high G content. At pH 4.0 and 2.65, the stoichiometry was 28–48 and 3–10 β-Lg molecules bound per alginate, respectively, increasing with higher M content. The findings will contribute to the design of formation of the desired alginate–protein particles in the acidic pH range.},

	abstract = {A multi-scale investigation of pea proteins – alginate cold-set gels was proposed in this study. The gel preparation followed a two-steps procedure. Globular pea proteins were first denatured and aggregated by a pre-heating step. Sodium alginate was then added at different concentrations. Thereafter the in situ gelation process was induced at 20 °C using glucono-δ-lactone (GDL) and two calcium carbonate (CC) levels; calcium cations were released as the pH decreased. Small-amplitude rheology measurements (storage modulus G′) showed that stronger mixed gels were obtained than single-biopolymer solutions. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) revealed phase-separating microstructures of mixed gels, foremost owing to biopolymers incompatibility. Phase separation was kinetically entrapped by gelation at different evolution stages. According to the co-occurrence method and microstructure classification, image texture analysis disclosed that a continuous protein network dispersing small gelled alginate microdomains corresponded to the strongest mixed gels. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) evidenced that during gelation, the pre-aggregated proteins were mainly associated into large agglomerates with no peculiar pattern. Higher cohesiveness between both networks was hypothesized, since protein agglomerates could expose “anchoring points” for alginate chains. Depending on both protein – alginate initial composition and calcium availability, non-specific inter-biopolymer cross-links via calcium were assumed to be the key factor of synergism within mixed gels.},

Alginate salts (ALG) are linear anionic polysaccharides obtained at a low cost from brown algae, displaying a good enough biocompatibility to be considered for medical applications. As alginates are quite hydrophilic, the exchange of ions from guluronic acid present in its molecular structure with divalent cations, particularly Ca2+, may induce its gelation, which would inhibit its solubilization in water. Both biopolymers SPI and ALG were used to produce composites through injection moulding using glycerol (Gly) as a plasticizer. Different biopolymer/plasticizer ratios were employed, and the SPI/ALG ratio within the biopolymer fraction was also varied. Furthermore, composites were immersed in different CaCl2 solutions to inhibit the amount of soluble matter loss and to enhance the mechanical properties of the resulting porous matrices. The main goal of the present work was the development and characterization of green porous matrices with inhibited solubility thanks to the gelation of alginate.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Yolk contamination of egg white is a common problem in the egg breaking industry. Foaming properties of egg white protein are affected by such contamination, but proteins of basic nature may restore the foaming properties of the yolk-contaminated egg white protein. The purpose of this study was to chemically modify a soy protein, that is, to esterify the acidic groups on the protein and to study the potential of such modified protein in improving foaming. We showed that the modification changed the isoelectric point of soy protein isolate (SPI) from 4.5 to about 10. Sonication was proven to be a very effective means to redisperse the methanol-denatured soy protein during reaction, as shown by the improved solubility profile. Such modified basic protein, that is, the sonicated-modified SPI (SMSPI), when added to the yolk-contaminated (at 0.4\% level, as-is basis) egg white, gave significantly improved foaming properties. We have shown that the slight change in pH due to the addition of SMSPI was not the reason for improved foaming performance; instead, the modified protein itself was the main reason for such improvement. Addition of SMSPI increased the foaming performance of both pure egg white and yolk-contaminated egg white. SMSPI consistently performed better than the unmodified SPI for improving foaming. Addition of SMSPI (16\%, based on dry egg white, and 1.6\% based on liquid egg white) fully restored foam expansion and foam liquid stability of 0.4\% yolk-contaminated egg white, and it even out-performed the foaming of pure white protein. Therefore, a feasible solution to restore the foaming properties of yolk-contaminated egg white has been identified. It is expected that such modified SPI can be used as an additive or ingredient in foaming formulation, especially when the egg white protein is suspected of lipid contamination.},

The endothermic signals obtained upon titration of soy proteins with Ca were fitted with a one set of sites model. NH soy proteins bound more Ca than H soy proteins (∼52 and ∼2 mg of Ca/g of proteins, respectively). The binding constant K indicated the easier Ca binding onto H soy proteins than for NH soy proteins. The exothermic part involved by electrostatic interactions was completely hidden by the strong endothermic signal from the water molecule release. Ca binding onto soy proteins should be described as a H+/Ca2+ exchange. Whatever the soy proteins, the positive value of heat capacity changes indicated a reduction in the number of surface-exposed polar residues. Ca-induced soy protein aggregation was irreversible for pH cycle to 3.5.},

Based on a literature review and interviews conducted in several companies throughout Europe, the following quality parameters are of particular importance: fat content, composition and distribution of the fat in the fillet; color intensity and distribution of the color in the fillet; and texture, where firmness (hardness and elasticity) and gaping are the main parameters for fresh salmon. Other parameters cited are white stripes (connective tissue), bleeding, blood stains, marbles, and melanin. Fat, pigments, and collagen are distributed differently over the salmon fillets. Consequently, the numerical values of the quality parameters are different depending on where the sample is collected from the fillet. Sampling is the most important factor in the evaluation of salmon fillet quality. Many sampling procedures are available and the technique differs widely and samples are collected from the head to the gut opening, depending on the country, research institute, or company. Fat content can be measured by both destructive and non‐destructive methods. Several destructive chemical extraction methods are commonly used, but the non‐destructive methods available are, for example, the Tony Fish Fat meter and near infrared technology, but they are used to a limited extent in the industry. The elite image and high market value of salmonids are due in part to the characteristic color of their flesh. The color of the flesh is an important criterion for the quality of salmon and hence crucial for marketing. It is not only important that the fish have satisfactory flesh color, but the pigmentation must be uniform and stable during storage. Methods to determine the degree of pigmentation of salmon fillets can be divided into two main groups; destructive chemical analysis for quantification of the pigments astaxanthin/ canthaxanthin in the flesh and non‐destructive methods based on estimating the color appearance. Color of salmon fillets is determined by using the Roche color card or a chroma meter reflectance instrument. Texture is commonly examined by the so‐called finger method in the industry. A finger is pressed on the skin or the fillet and the firmness is evaluated. Texture of salmon fillets is measured by different tests using “Instron‐like”; instruments. However, the results depend on the location where the fish/fillet is pressed and how firmly it is pressed. To select one method and recommend it depends on the application purposes. These methods have to be tested further and comparisons made between different methods before it is possible to recommend the best available method for each application.},

The results of microscopy and light scattering indicated that WPI had better emulsifying properties than SPI, resulting in emulsions with smaller and more even droplet size distribution. The rheological properties of protein/alginate mixtures and emulsions indicated strong interactions between WPI and alginate and weak interactions between SPI and alginate, resulting in increased Young's modulus of WPI-stabilized emulsion gel beads and decreased Young's modulus of SPI-stabilized emulsion gel beads, compared to gel beads without proteins. The presence of WPI and SPI increased changes of Young's modulus and shrinkage during simulated gastric digestion and delayed the release of lycopene from gel beads.

	abstract = {For countries with a long coastal line seaweed has traditionally been part of the common diet.
However, in the Western world today seaweed is most often associated with Asian diets and
the red algae nori in the popular dish sushi. During the last decades with the awareness of
climate change, there has been an increase in the demand for sustainable food products. Addi-
tionally, there is an increasing consciousness regarding products with less processed additives.
Incorporating seaweed (macroalgae) into food products may be part of the solution regarding
these new trends. A common red algae additive used in food products is carrageenan. This
hydrocolloid is among other things added to pork liver pâté where it provides the desired and
stable texture. The goal of the project was to analyse if substitution of carrageenan with dried
Alaria esculenta (AE) or Saccharina latissima (SL) in pork liver pâté could lead to the same
texture. The seaweeds were slightly processed in different ways before adding them in the pâté.
Parameters for texture analysing with the Stable Micro Systems texture analyser TA.TXplusC
were optimised by measuring three chosen commercial pâtés. The parameters found were a
cylinder probe with diameter 12.7 mm, setting the speed to 1.5 mm/s and depth to 12 mm.
These were then used on the pâtés made at the food processing laboratory at NTNU Akrinn.
The substitution of carrageenan with dried AE proved to give more similarities with car-
rageenan than SL substitution. Substitution with tripled amounts of AE and pre-treated AE
gave a similar textural result as carrageenan. However, it is difficult to conclude if the change
in texture is due to the alginate in the brown seaweed or the addition of seaweed particles in
the food matrix. Storing the pâtés for one week showed irregular results. Due to the few and
varying results, it was difficult to draw a conclusion from these results.
Pork liver pâté is a complex food matrix with proteins, lipids, some carbohydrates and a
substantial amount of water. Further investigations should include how different hydrocolloids
work in this food system. Also, is would be interesting to study how much pre-treatment brown
algae actually needs before it is possible to see the alginate’s thickening effect. Finally, future
work could look into other rheological parameters such as viscosity, elasticity and spreadability
of the pâté and other interesting aspects such as colour changes and taste of the product.},

	abstract = {Verdsomspennande matproduksjon møter no ei større utfordring enn nokon sinne. Aukande populasjon gjev auka etterspurnad etter mat, spesielt protein. Me må utvikle nye, berekraftige matforsyningar, som for eksempel akvatiske planter. Sjøgras kan ha relativt høgt proteininnhald og inneheld andre viktige næringsstoff, i tillegg til å ha eit lågt kaloriinnhald. Brunalgar har lågare proteininnhald samanlikna med raude og grøne artar, men dei er større, tilgjengelege i store mengder langs kysten, og kan enkelt dyrkast i Noreg. Dei veks ikkje djupt og kan derfor haustast enkelt, billig og raskt. Dette gjev brunalgar eit høgt potensial for storskala produksjon til bruk som mat og næringsstoff.

Trass i sine eigna karakteristikkar og høgt potensial for bruk i mat og fór, er makroalger framleis underutnytta ressursar. Dette er delvis grunna manglande kunnskap som gjev ein dårleg marknad og låg etterspurnad i Vesten. Utfordringar er også uønskte komponentar til stades i makroalger som gjer dei uønskeleg eller farlege å ete, i tillegg til låg biotilgjengelegheit av ønska næringsstoff. Begge desse problema kan ein overvinne ved å ekstrahere næringsstoff frå makroalgane,  og det er derfor naudsynt å studere og forbetre spesifikke ekstraksjonsmetodar. Ekstraksjon assistert med ultralydbehandling og enzymhydrolyse kan gi effektiv degradering av biomasse med redusert forbruk av tid, løysemiddel og energi. Dette er meir berekraftig, økonomisk gunstig og reproduserbart samanlikna med konvensjonelle teknikkar.

Målet med denne masteravhandlinga var å undersøke proteinekstraksjon frå to brunalgeartar frå Norskekysten, Saccharina latissima og Alaria esculenta. Fokus var ulike metodar for forbehandling av makroalgane, og korleis dette påverkar proteinekstraksjon. Effekten av enkel og kombinert behandling ved ultralydbølger og enzym vart drøfta. Ultralydbølger vart brukt til å kollapse celleveggen for å frigjere innfanga protein, og deretter auke proteinekstraksjon. Enzyma Alginat lyase, Viscozyme L og Cellic CTec2 vart brukt til degradering av polysakkarid i celleveggen, og Alkalase skulle stå for proteolytisk nedbryting av peptidbindingar i protein. Proteinanalyse vart hovudsakleg gjort ved Lowry-metoden, men nokre prøvar vart også målt med CN-analyse og total aminosyreanalyse til samanlikning.

Resultat viser at enzym og sonikering aukar proteinekstraksjon i S. latissima og A. esculenta. Effektiviteten til proteinekstraksjon avhenger av mengdeforholdet mellom vatn og alge, innstillingar for sonikering, enzymkonsentrasjon, polyfenolinnhald i algane, tilstanden til biomassen (våt eller tørr), og graden av degradering før behandling. Også kombinasjonen av ulike behandlingar og behandlingsrekkjefølge er avgjerande. Det var signifikante forskjellar mellom gamal og ny S. latissima, med opp til 240 \% auka utbytte frå proteinekstraksjon i det gamle partiet, grunna delvis degradert biomasse. Det var positiv korrelasjon mellom ekstraksjon av polyfenolar og protein i begge algar, men effekten var meir tydeleg i A. esculenta. Enzymkonsentrasjonane med best proteinutbytte for våt alge var 100 U/g (tørrvekt) Alginat lyase og 3 \% (våtvekt) Cellic CTec2 for begge algeartar, og høvesvis 196 μl/g og 98 μl/g Viscozyme for S. latissima og A. esculenta. 

Kombinert behandling frå enzym og sonikering gav auka utbytte i både våt og tørr alge. Sonikering etterfylgt av enzym såg ut til å vere den beste rekkjefølga for behandling, men dette var ikkje einrøystes for alle tilfelle. Tørr alge gav signifikant høgare utbytte enn våt alge for alle samanlikna behandlingar bortsett frå éi. For tørr alge gav sonikering kombinert med enzym auka proteinutbytte samanlikna med enzym og sonikering aleine, men forbetringa var ikkje alltid signifikant. Høgst proteinutbytte for tørr alge var frå behandling med US  Alginat lyase for S. latissima med 6.01 ± 0.03 \% (tørrvekt) og US  Cellic CTec2 for A. esculenta med 5.59 ± 0.21 \% (tørrvekt). 

Sekvensiell enzymbehandling med Cellic og/eller Alkalase gav signifikant auke i proteinutbytte. Alkalase, aleine eller kombinert med Cellic CTec, gav signifikant høgre proteinutbytte samanlikna med Cellic CTec aleine. Høgst proteinutbytte var frå behandling av Alkalase for våt S. latissima med proteinutbytte på 11.75 ± 0.63 \% (tørrvekt) og  Cellic CTec + Alkalase for våt A. esculenta med utbytte på 6.05 ± 0.09 \% (tørrvekt). Dette var behandlingane med høgst proteinutbytte blant alle eksperiment. Likevel såg Cellic CTec ut til å redusere størrelsen på proteina i større grad enn Alkalase. Aminosyreprofilane viste at alle målte aminosyrer er til stades i alle ekstrakt, og det er mest av aminosyrene alanin, glutaminsyre og aspartinsyre. Proteinutbytte varierer i forhold til analysemetoden som vert brukt. Lowry-analysen gav høgare utbytte enn CN- og total aminosyreanalyse. Det beste estimatet for proteinutbytte er antatt å vere ein mellomting mellom det som er målt frå dei tre metodane.

Utbytte ved ekstraksjon frå S. latissima var høgre enn for A. esculenta i alle eksperiment, med få unntak. Behandling med enzym var meir effektivt for S. latissima, mens ultralyd påverka A. esculenta i større grad. Totalt sett er ekstraksjon mest lovande frå biomasse som har fått påført kombinert behandling, enten ein kombinasjon av sonikering og enzym eller fleire enzym med ulik spesifisitet.},

	abstract = {Makroalger brukes som mat og som råmateriale for ekstraksjon av tilsetningsstoffer og funksjonelle forbindelser i blant annet matindustrien, kosmetikkindustrien og farmasøytisk industri. I løpet av de siste årene har den vitenskapelige og industrielle interessen for makroalger økt på grunn av deres potensiale innen bærekraftig produksjon av mat, energi og kjemikalier. Det har også vært en økt interesse blant forbrukere på grunn av det gunstige næringsinnholdet i makroalger, og innholdet av potensielt helsefremmende funksjonelle forbindelser. Passende konserveringsmetoder under frakt og lagring er nødvendige for å unngå forråtnelse av biomassen etter høsting. Frysing er en populær konserveringsmetode, men frysing og tining av makroalger fører til et betydelig drypptap. I denne oppgaven ble den kjemiske sammensetningen av drypptap fra tining, også kalt tinevann, av frosne prøver av makroalgeartene Saccharina latissima og Alaria esculenta analysert. Dette ble gjort for å se hvordan makroalgene ble påvirket av tining og frysing, og om tinevannprøvene kunne bli brukt som en supplerende inntektskilde i industrien. Konsentrasjonene av fuktighet, tørrstoff, aske, proteiner, totale aminosyrer og noen karbohydrater (mannitol, fucose, glukose, galaktose og mannose/xylose) ble bestemt for råstoffene, tinevannprøvene og restråstoffene etter tining og fjerning av tinevann. I tillegg ble konsentrasjonene av mineraler, fenoler og frie aminosyrer, og antioksidantaktiviteten bestemt for tinevannprøvene.

Tining av frossent Saccharina latissima og Alaria esculenta råstoff ga tinevann som utgjorde henholdsvis 49\% og 55\% av råstoffets våtvekt. Tinevannprøvene innehold over 90\% fuktighet og litt tørrstoff. Over 70\% av tørrstoffet var mineraler. Mineralinnholdet var dominert av natrium og kalium i begge tinevannprøvene. Jodinnholdet var også ganske høyt, spesielt for Saccharina latissima tinevannet. Det var også noe arsenikk, kvikksølv og kadmium i tinevannprøvene. Fenol- og proteinkonsentrasjonene var lave, begge disse, i tillegg til antioksidantaktiviteten, var høyere i Saccharina latissima tinevannet enn i Alaria esculenta tinevannet. Proteininnholdet virket som om det besto hovedsakelig av små peptider og frie aminosyrer. Av de målte karbohydratene var mannitol den det var mest av i tinevannprøvene. Noe fukose og glukose antydet også at det var noe fucoidan og laminaran i prøvene. Av aminosyrer var det mest alanin i tinevannprøvene, etterfulgt av mindre mengder glutaminsyre og asparaginsyre. Disse resultatene ga ingen innlysende bruksområder for tinevannprøvene. Ekstraksjon av jod og mannitol for videre industriell bruk virket som de mest realistiske bruksområdene. Dette antydet at næringsverdien av råstoffene ikke ble vesentlig påvirket av frysing og tining. Det er mulig at tining og frysing gjorde at restråstoffene hadde et sunnere mineralinnhold enn råstoffet på grunn av fjerning av jod og giftige tungmetaller. Tap av mannitol, alanin, glutaminsyre og asparaginsyre kan bety at smaken av restråstoffet er annerledes enn av råstoffet.},

In this study, the carbohydrate composition and protein levels of L. digitata and S. latissima from three different sites in Denmark were compared for 1 year, and compositional variations of wild L. digitata harvested in August from the North Sea was monitored for 3 years. Glucan levels of L. digitata were consistently higher than those of S. latissima irrespective of harvest site and time of the year. Glucan levels in wild L. digitata from Kattegat peaked in October with 37.0\% by dry weight compared to 22.6\% by dry weight in wild S. latissima (Kattegat) and were accompanied by lower ash contents (18.5\% w/w in L. digitata versus 26.5\% w/w inS. latissima). Alginate contents were almost constant throughout the year, but mannuronic/glucuronic acid ratios differed between species and location from 1.33 to 3.64. Wild L. digitata harvested from the North Sea in August contained {\textgreater}50\% glucans by weight and had low ash contents for three consecutive years (2012–2014). Compositional variation of the seaweeds was mainly related to season but also varied with species, location, and within populations. Among environmental variables (temperature, salinity, phosphate, nitrate, ammonia), only temperature was found to correlate with the chemical composition of the seaweeds. Amino acid profiles were dominated by glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and alanine and varied with season, especially for L. digitata from the North Sea, and location. Total nitrogen contents fluctuated more between samples than the actual protein contents; hence, application of a common N-to-protein factor cannot be recommended.},

	abstract = {The seasonal chemical profiling of kelp species has historically either being carried out on only a single species or the data dates back over 60 years. This research highlights a detailed chemical composition profile of the four kelp species Laminaria digitata, Laminaria hyperborea, Saccharina latissima and Alaria esculenta over a 14-month period. These kelp species were selected due to their identified potential for cultivation. They were chemically characterised to identify seasonal variations and predict best harvest times. Components of interest included the carbohydrates cellulose, laminarin, alginate and mannitol as well as proteins, ash, metals, moisture, polyphenolics, total carbon and nitrogen content. The highest yields of lamianrin and mannitol coincided with the lowest yields in ash, protein, moisture and polyphenols. The implications of these observations for use of kelp species as a fermentation substrate are discussed.},

	abstract = {A new reversible gelation pathway is described for alginates in aqueous media. From various samples differing by their mannuronic/guluronic content (M/G), both enthalpic and viscoelastic experiments demonstrate that alginates having a high M content are able to form thermoreversible assemblies in the presence of potassium salts. The aggregation behavior is driven by the low solubility of M-blocks at low temperature and high ionic strength. In semidilute solutions, responsive assemblies induce a strong increase of the viscosity below a critical temperature. A true physical gel is obtained in the entangled regime, although the length scale of specific interactions between M-blocks decreases with increasing density of entanglements. Cold setting takes place at low temperatures, below 0 °C for potassium concentrations lower than 0.2 mol/kg, but the aggregation process can be easily shifted to higher temperatures by increasing the salt concentration. The self-assembling process of alginates in solution of potassium salts is characterized by a sharp gelation exotherm and a broad melting endotherm with a large hysteresis of 20−30 °C between the transition temperatures. The viscoelastic properties of alginate gels in potassium salts closely depend on thermal treatment (rate of cooling, time, and temperature of storage), polymer and salt concentrations, and monomer composition as well. In the case of alginates with a high G content, a similar aggregation behavior is also evidenced at higher salt concentrations, but the extent of the self-assembling process remains too weak to develop a true gelation behavior in solution.},

Hydrocolloids play two main roles in fried food development. One is to form a fine ‘invisible’ coating, practically on their own, when their main purpose is to avoid excessive oil absorption during the pre-frying and frying processes. In the other, when they are added to the batter among its other ingredients, they are used to avoid oil absorption too, but they also act as viscosity control agents, improve adhesion, pick-up control and freeze-thaw stability or help to retain the crispness of the battered/breaded fried foods.

	abstract = {Defatting and dry fractionation of soybean flour by the combination of impact milling and tribo-electrostatic separation was investigated to prepare protein–enriched soybean flour. Defatting is crucial to facilitate dry milling required for dry fractionation. Both organic solvent extraction and oil pressing were suitable as defatting methods although oil pressing compacted the tissue structure visually. Moderate impact milling (classifier wheel speed of 3000 rpm) effectively liberated protein bodies while eliminating agglomeration of small particles. Electrostatic separation was conducted with varying charging tube configurations. We found higher yields in the separation with a spiral charging tube design than with a slit design. The soy flour was enriched in protein from 37 g/100 g to 45 g/100 g dry basis by defatting. During electrostatic separation a soy protein enrichment of 15\% was achieved and a yield of 62\% of the protein was recovered from the defatted soy flour.
Industrial applications
The production of soy protein isolates and soy protein concentrates with wet fractionation consumes a lot of water and energy. Meanwhile, the ingredients lose their native state and part of their functionality due to the harsh processing conditions. This study proposed a dry fractionation method combining fine milling and electrostatic separation for the preparation of soybean protein-enriched fractions retaining the native state of the protein. Although the proposed dry fractionation for protein-enriched fractions from oilseeds is promising, still challenges are ahead for upscaling the process, being efficient and safe in its operation.},

Additionally, the G′ values of gels initially increased with increasing NaCl concentration from 0 to 0.25 M, but decreased with further increasing ionic strength from 0.25 to 0.50 M. This trend was consistent with the variation of heat-induced protein aggregates size in soy protein solution at the same ionic strength. Higher 11S/7S ratio resulted in higher storage modulus values of soy protein gels due to the formation of larger and compacter aggregates mainly by B polypeptides via hydrophobic bonds.},

The gelling capacity of the protein fractions was studied at pH values of 3 and 7 using oscillatory measurements, mechanical properties and water holding capacity. The rheological measurements showed that viscous modulus (G″) predominated at low temperatures and the elastic modulus (G′) at high temperatures. At pH 3, the G′–G″ crossover occurred at lower temperatures when compared to pH 7. This behaviour was more accentuated for the 11S fractions due to its capacity to form stronger gels. An increase of drying temperature led to a displacement of the gel point to higher temperatures and decreased the elasticity modulus or gelling capacity of protein fractions. These results were confirmed by the mechanical properties, since at higher temperatures the gels were more fragile and brittle, especially when formed at pH 7.},

	abstract = {Background
There is increasing consensus that transitioning towards reduced meat consumption and more plant-based diets is a key feature to address important health and sustainability challenges. However, relevant evidence that may inform these transitions remains fragmented with no overarching rationale or theoretical framework, which limits the ability to design and deliver coordinated efforts to address these challenges.
Scope and approach
Eleven databases were systematically searched using sets of keywords referring meat curtailment, meat substitution and plant-based diets, as well as consumer choice, appraisal or behavior (2602 articles selected for title and abstract screening; 161 full-texts assessed for eligibility; 110 articles selected for extraction and coding). Barriers and enablers were identified and integrated into an overarching framework (i.e., COM-B system), which conceptualizes behavior as being influenced by three broad components: capability, opportunity and motivation.
Key findings and conclusions
This review mapped potential barriers and enablers in terms of capability, opportunity, and motivation to reduce meat consumption and follow more plant-based diets. These included lack of information for consumers and difficulty to acquire new cooking skills (barrier, capability), changes in service provision in collective meal contexts (enabler, opportunity), and positive taste expectations for plant-based meals (enabler, motivation). Evidence on variables referring to the motivation domain is clearly increasing, but there is a striking need for studies that include capability and opportunity variables as well. The results of this review are relevant to a variety of fields and audiences interested in promoting sustainable living and health improvements through dietary choice.},

Recent meat substitutes often have sustainable characteristics in line with consumers’ concerns over aspects of healthy food and the environmental impact of food production. However, changing lifestyles with less time for cooking, any transition from a strongly meat-based to a more plant-based diet depends on the successful establishment of convenient meat substitutes. This article reviews the growing body of research on meat substitutes. These research articles were classified into five different stages in line with the innovation-decision process of: knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation and confirmation. The research was analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively, with results suggesting that although health, environmental and animal welfare aspects can persuade consumers and influence their decision to try a meat substitute, the appearance and taste of those meat substitutes are crucial factors for their consumption on a regular basis. However, there still remains a gap in research articles focusing on the regular consumption of meat substitutes.},

The livestock industry is one of the major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, water use, land use, and deforestation. Moreover, there are ethical and health concerns linked to certain types of meat product. If we could reduce our dependence on the meat, milk, and eggs produced by animals, we could greatly improve the sustainability of our food supply. This chapter highlights some of the issues involved in trying to create a more sustainable future using the humble burger as an example. Many people want foods that look, feel, and taste like animal products, but are made from something else. The creation of desirable meat-alternatives depends on first understanding what makes meat products taste so delicious. For this reason, this chapter begins by highlighting the complex science underlying hamburger deliciousness. The development of meat-alternatives using cultured meat grown in test-tubes, insects grown in bug farms, and plant-based ingredients coaxed into meat-like structures is then highlighted. The ethical issues related to cultured meat are discussed – should we eat meat from animals, superstars, or even ourselves if no one is hurt? The challenges associated with many people’s natural aversion to eating bugs are highlighted, as well as the novel ways scientists are trying to understand and overcome these challenges. The ethical dilemma facing vegans who want us all to stop eating animal products are highlighted – what will we do with all the livestock?},

Given the worldwide growing demand of meat, and the severe impact of meat production on the planet, reducing animal protein consumption is a matter of food security and public health. Changing consumer food behavior is a challenge. Taste preferences, culinary traditions and social norms factor into food choices. Since behavioral change cannot occur without the subject’s positive attitude based on reasons and motivations, a total of 34 papers on consumer attitudes and behavior towards meat consumption in relation to environmental concerns were examined. The results show that consumers aware of the meat impact on the planet, willing to stop or significantly reduce meat consumption for environmental reasons, and who have already changed their meat intake for ecological concerns are a small minority. However, environmental motives are already appealing significant proportions of Westerners to adopt certain meat curtailment strategies. Those who limit meat intake for environmental reasons are typically female, young, simply meat-reducer (not vegan/vegetarian), ecology-oriented, and would more likely live in Europe and Asia than in the U.S.},

The aim of this study was to examine (i) the overall liking, perceived quality and nutritiousness, and (ii) the emotional and sensory profiling of three commercially available burgers (insect-based, plant-based and meat-based), under blind, expected and informed conditions. In total, 97 young adults took part in this experiment, divided into two sessions to assess the effect of blind tasting. The findings of the study revealed that although the overall liking for the insect burger was comparable to the liking for the plant-based burger, further product development is needed to improve its sensory quality. Complete assimilation occurred for the insect-based burger, which shows that information influenced overall liking. In addition, the informed condition had little influence on emotional conceptualisations.

	abstract = {Background
Plant-based meat alternatives are developed to address consumer demands and sustainability of future food supply, and the market has grown exponentially in recent years. Although progresses have been made to construct plant protein-based fibers organoleptically comparable to a whole-muscle cut, it remains challenging to reproduce the hierarchical organization of muscle tissue known to contribute to the overall sensory profile. For now, the market strategies are largely focused on restructured or formed meat mimeticks.
Scope and approaches
Literature search and supermarket surveys are conducted to identify processing technologies, product formulations, and the chemistry and functionality of various additives applied in meat alternatives production. Comparisons are made between muscle and legume proteins to elucidate disparities in macroscopic aggregation properties that may be greatly diminished through fabrication and ingredient innovation. Due to the highly formulated and processed nature, the nutrition, health, and safety of plant-based meat alternatives are analyzed.
Key findings and conclusion
Thermoextrusion is found to be the principal reconstructuring technique for meat-like fiber synthesis from plant proteins. Soy and pea proteins, gluten, and polysaccharides are the major building blocks. Through physicochemical interactions, plant proteins are able to aggregate into particles and anisotropic fibrils to impart meat-like texture and mouthfeel. Vegetable oil blends and spices are used to modify the texture and flavor; pigments are added to impart color; vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and antimicrobials are incorporated to boost nutrition and improve shelf-life. Opportunities exist to overcome technology obstacles and nutrition and safety challenges in further developing the alternatives market.},

Thus, the use of alginate has been expanded so as to be directed towards the pharmaceutical and biomedical industries, where studies have shown that it can be used successfully as biomaterial for wound, hydrogel, and aerogel dressings, among others. Furthermore, the ability to encapsulate natural substances has led to the possibility of using alginate as a drug coating and drug delivery agent, including the encapsulation of probiotics. This is important considering the fact that, until recently, encapsulation and coating agents used in the pharmaceutical industry were limited to the use of lactose, a potentially allergenic agent or gelatin. Obtained at a relatively low cost from marine brown algae, this hydrocolloid can also be used as a potential tool in the management of diabetes, not only as an insulin delivery agent but also due to its ability to improve insulin resistance, attenuate chronic inflammation and decrease oxidative stress. In addition, alginate has been recognized as a potential weight loss treatment, as alginate supplementation has been used as an adjunct treatment to energy restriction, to enhance satiety and improve weight loss in obese individuals. Thus, alginate holds the promise of an effective product used in the food industry as well as in the management of metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity. This review highlights recent research advances on the characteristics of alginate and brings to the forefront the beneficial aspects of using alginate, from the food industry to the biomedical field.},

	abstract = {Seaweed residues from Alaria esculenta, Saccharina latissima and Ascophyllum nodosum after alginate extraction have been valorized to produce cellulose-based fractions with different purification degrees. The residues were mainly composed of carbohydrates (35–57\%) and proteins (12–37\%), Alaria and Saccharina being richer in cellulose and Ascophyllum richer in fucoidan. The lower cellulose content in the latter made it unsuitable for the extraction of cellulosic fractions. Self-supporting films were obtained from the cellulosic fractions from Saccharina and Alaria residues. While the higher cellulose purity films presented more desirable characteristics in terms of mechanical properties (with elastic moduli of ca. 5–7 GPa and elongation values of ca. 3–5\%) and visual appearance, the presence of non-cellulosic components in the films from less purified fractions reduced their water sensitivity and promoted greater water barrier (with water permeability values of ca. 4–6 kg·m/s·m2·Pa). These results point towards the potential of a simple alkaline extraction to generate cellulose-based films from seaweed residuals with the best compromise between functional properties and economical and environmental efficiency.},

	abstract = {Eating less meat is increasingly seen as a healthier, more ethical option. This is leading to growing numbers of flexitarian consumers looking for plant-based meat alternatives (PBMAs) to replace at least some of the animal meat they consume. Popular PBMA products amongst flexitarians, including plant-based mince, burgers, sausages and meatballs, are often perceived as low-quality, ultra-processed foods. However, we argue that the mere industrial processing of ingredients of plant origin does not make a PBMA product ultra-processed by default. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a randomised controlled trial to assess the changes to the gut microbiota of a group of 20 participants who replaced several meat-containing meals per week with meals cooked with PBMA products and compared these changes to those experienced by a size-matched control. Stool samples were subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing. The resulting raw data was analysed in a compositionality-aware manner, using a range of innovative bioinformatic methods. Noteworthy changes included an increase in butyrate metabolising potential—chiefly in the 4-aminobutyrate/succinate and glutarate pathways—and in the joint abundance of butyrate-producing taxa in the intervention group compared to control. We also observed a decrease in the Tenericutes phylum in the intervention group and an increase in the control group. Based on our findings, we concluded that the occasional replacement of animal meat with PBMA products seen in flexitarian dietary patterns can promote positive changes in the gut microbiome of consumers.},

The objective of this study was to replace completely and partially meat by plant proteins in sausage formulation and compare the characteristics of these novel formulae with full meat sample. The results showed that the plant proteins minimized the cooking loss and shrinkage and improved emulsion stability by creating a strong structural network in cooked emulsion. In contrast, the full meat samples had better strength/elasticity in terms of folding score (4.67 out of 5) and gel strength (2553.68 g mm) when compared to meat-reduced and meat-free samples. The sensory assessment showed that replacement of chicken meat by plant proteins was highly acceptable in terms of texture, odor, color and overall acceptance. Overall, it is concluded that plant proteins can be regarded as promising ingredients to replace 80–100\% meat in sausage.},

Formation of anisotropic structures was investigated at various process conditions, characterized by extruder temperature (100–143 °C), extruder pressure (1.7–2.7 MPa), and specific mechanical energy input (85–350 kJ/kg). At these conditions, anisotropy occurred with increased extrusion temperature. Compared to untreated SPC, no change in protein-protein interactions occurred for extruded samples. Applying a Closed Cavity Rheometer allowed investigating the influence of defined thermomechanical treatment on rheological properties. Increasing thermal treatment had a pronounced influence on flow behavior, causing a decrease in complex viscosity. Since protein-protein interactions were not influenced, these findings imply that structural changes of polysaccharides present in SPC could be responsible for the significant change in rheological properties, which is expected to play a major role on the formation of anisotropic structures.},

Higher free water content of meat analogue due to water treatment resulted in a decrease in viscoelasticity, the highest CL value, the lowest WHC and hardness value, and a porous structure. Reversely, meat analogue with oil treatment had an increase in viscoelasticity, the lowest CL value, the highest WHC and hardness value, and a dense structure due to hydrophobic interactions. SPI had a positive effect on the gel network formation of TVP matrix, but lecithin had a negative effect resulting in a decrease in viscoelasticity, WHC, hardness value and an increase in CL value and pore size at microstructure. The results of sensory evaluation revealed that juiciness was more affected by water than oil. Oil treatment showed high intensity for texture parameters. On the other hand, emulsion treatment showed high preference scores for texture parameters and overall acceptance.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The direct consumption of vegetable proteins in food products has been increasing over the years because of animal diseases, global shortage of animal protein, strong demand for wholesome and religious (halal) food, and economic reasons. The increasing importance of legume and oilseed proteins in the manufacturing of various functional food products is due to their high-protein contents. However, the greatest obstacle to utilizing these legumes and oilseeds is the presence of antinutrients; but these antinutrients can be successfully removed or inactivated by employing certain processing methods. In contrast, the potential negative impact of the antinutrients is partially balanced by the fact that they may have a health-promoting role. Legumes and oilseeds provide well-balanced amino acid profiles when consumed with cereals. Soybean proteins, wheat gluten, cottonseed proteins, and other plant proteins have been used for texturization. Texturized vegetable proteins can extend meat products while providing an economical, functional, and high-protein food ingredient or can be consumed directly as a meat analog. Meat analogs are successful because of their healthy image (cholesterol free), meat-like texture, and low cost. Mycoprotein is fungal in origin and is used as a high-protein, low-fat, health-promoting food ingredient. Mycoprotein has a good taste and texture. Texturized vegetable proteins and a number of mycoprotein products are accepted as halal foods. This article summarizes information regarding the molecular, nutritional, and functional properties of alternative protein sources to meat and presents current knowledge to encourage further research to optimize the beneficial effects of alternative protein sources.},

Vacuum frying process is an alternative frying process that increases the quality of foods. The objective was to develop instant noodles aiming to reduce carbohydrate and fat content by adding soy protein isolate (SPI) and resistant starch (RS3), using conventional and vacuum frying processes. A 22 central composite rotational design was used for each type of process, and the formulations were optimized using the Response Surface Methodology. The noodles were characterized with respect to fat absorption, cooking time, final resistant starch content and firmness. The noodles produced at the optimized point were also characterized for their isoflavone content, amino acid profile and by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). The response surfaces showed that the addition of SPI and RS3 to the formulation resulted in reduced fat absorption and texture. Comparing both frying processes it was found that noodles obtained by vacuum frying absorbed 3\% less fat and were less firm than those produced by conventional frying process. The SEM analysis showed that the noodles obtained by conventional frying had a more porous structure, which allowed an easier fat penetration, whereas those produced by vacuum frying showed a more closed structure with fat impregnated on the surface. Regardless of the process used, it was possible to obtain noodles with improved nutritional value, since they showed high fibre (8\%) and protein (approximately 11\%) contents, considerable isoflavone content (8.20 mg/100 g) and a complete amino acid profile, due to a significant increase in nearly all the amino acids, especially lysine.},

In this paper, the formation conditions, thermodynamic formation mechanism, and morphologic structure of soy protein isolate/lactoferrin (SPI/LF) complex coacervate were investigated. The SPI/LF complex coacervates prepared under optimal conditions were electrically neutral and followed the principle of charge compensation. Electrophoresis and isothermal titration calorimetry verified that all individual SPI fractions participated in HPCC and the stoichiometry of the SPI/LF complexes was the same as their optimal mixing ratio. Moreover, SPI/LF complex coacervation was thermodynamically favoured (ΔG {\textless} 0), which resulted from entropy gain (TΔS {\textgreater} 0) and negative enthalpy change (ΔH {\textless} 0). Not only electrostatic interactions but also hydrogen bonds participated in the complex coacervation. The SPI/LF interaction improved the heat-stability of heat-sensitive lobe in LF. Furthermore, the SPI/LF complex (pH 6.25, SPI/LF = 1:3) exhibited distinct granules, whereas the uniform crosslinking structure appeared in the other SPI/LF complex (pH 6.6, SPI/LF = 1:4). Atomic force microscope showed the sphere complex (pH 6.25-SPI/LF = 1:3) with a diameter of 50–150 nm and the chain-like complex (pH 6.6-SPI/LF = 1:4) with a length of 50–150 nm and a width of 20–80 nm.},

The gelatinization of starch granules played an important role on the rheological properties of the composite during heating. Scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy with the aid of histological technique revealed the microstructure of CS/SPC composites.

An increase in the pH of protein extraction, from 8.0 to 10.0, during CPI preparation promoted a partial denaturation of cowpea proteins. Increases in enthalpy change of denaturation (ΔH) and temperature of denaturation (Td) were detected with increasing protein concentration from 7.5 to 10.5\% (w/w). This behavior suggests that denaturation involves a first step of dissociation of protein aggregates. Calcium induced thermal stabilization in cowpea proteins, the increase in Td was ca. 0.3 °C/mM for protein dispersions of 7.5\% (w/w) for 0 to 40 mM CaCl2. High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) induced denaturation in CPI in a pressure level dependent manner. The presence of calcium protected cowpea proteins towards HHP-induced denaturation when pressure level was 400 MPa, but not when it was 600 MPa. Thermal properties of cowpea protein isolates were very sensitive to processing conditions, these behaviors would have implications in processing of CPI-containing foodstuff.},

	abstract = {High moisture extrusion cooking is a well-established method to develop soy-based meat alternatives. Algae are increasingly researched into as an alternative protein source, particularly the micro-algae spirulina (Arthrospira platensis) is known for its high protein content. However, little is known how spirulina behaves during the extrusion process. This study investigates the sensory properties of spirulina (10\%, 30\% or 50\%) and soy-based meat alternatives (16 samples) produced according to a Design of Experiment (DoE) with different levels of moisture (57\%, 67\% or 77\%), screw speed (600 rpm, 900 rpm or 1200 rpm), temperature (140 °C, 160 °C or 180 °C) and two production days (independent replicates). Conventional profiling by a trained sensory panel (n = 12) based on a product-specific vocabulary was carried out and the samples were also subjected to instrumental texture profile analysis (TPA) and razor shear measurement (MORS). The data revealed that high spirulina content caused a black color, an intense flavor with earthy notes and an algae odor that is rather musty. Additionally, the higher the share of spirulina, the lower were the elasticity, fibrousness and firmness of extruded samples. High moisture content resulted in products evoking a juicy and soft mouthfeel plus a moist appearance. Instrumentally measured texture parameters matched with the sensory profile regarding texture: high moisture induces a decrease in shear force, shear energy, hardness, cohesion, springiness and chewiness. Particularly firmness perceived by the panel correlates with both MORS and TPA measurements while sensory elasticity correlates with springiness. When keeping moisture low, but screw speed and temperature high during extrusion, it is possible to partly substitute soy with spirulina in order to produce firm and fibrous products with a decent algae flavor that will contribute to shape a more sustainable future for food.},

These promising protein sources present several advantages over other currently used raw materials from an environmental point of view. Additionally, one of the main characteristics of microalgae is the production of bioactive compounds with potential benefits for human health. Microalgae exploitation as a source of protein (bulk protein) and other valuable products within the food industry still presents some drawbacks, mainly because of the underdeveloped technologies and processes currently available for microalgae processing. The systematic improvement of the technology readiness level (TRL) could help change the current situation if applied to microalgae cultivation and processing. High maturity in microalgae cultivation and processing technologies also requires improvement of the economy of scale and investment of resources in new facilities and research. Antioxidative, antihypertensive, immunomodulatory, anticancerogenic, hepato-protective, and anticoagulant activities have been attributed to some microalgae-derived compounds such as peptides. Nevertheless, research on this topic is scarce and the evidence on potential health benefits is not strong. In the last years, the possibility of using microalgae-derived compounds for innovative functional food products has become of great interest, but the literature available mainly focuses more on the addition of the whole cells or some compound already available on the market. This review describes the status of utilising microalgae as an ingredient in innovative food products with potential health benefits.},

Here, we employ proteins extracted from Arthrospira platensis biomass to be used for the stabilization of fluid interfaces, which is one of the most important techno-functional applications of proteins. Model foams were prepared from crude A. platensis powder and A. platensis isolate and whey protein isolate as a reference. The derived A. platensis isolate exceeded the overrun and the foam stability of whey protein isolate. The comparable low surface activity of crude A. platensis powder emphasizes the need for the extraction process. The neutral color of the A. platensis isolate indicates that the valuable natural pigments present in A. platensis were retained while achieving relevant techno-functional properties with the residual biomass. Physical treatment with nanosecond pulsed electric fields further increased the biomass yield without impeding the techno-functional properties of the derived isolates. Thus, protein extraction from microalgae biomass is an interesting approach to obtain techno-functional proteins and increase microalgae production efficiency.},

	abstract = {The main objective of this study was to incorporate soy-based textured vegetable protein (TVP) into beef patties in different quantities (10–40\%) and compare various characteristics of these innovative formulations with a regular beef patty as a control. Incorporation of 10–40\% TVP resulted in significantly lower (p {\textless} 0.05) moisture and fat contents, while higher crude fiber contents were detected compared to beef as the control. In addition, cooked patties showed higher pH levels (p {\textless} 0.05), with color coordinates expressing lighter, yellowish, and slightly redder indices than raw patties. Similarly, a plant protein that includes TVP minimizes (p {\textless} 0.05) WHC (water holding capacity), both RW\% (release water) and CL\% (cooking loss). Furthermore, hardness, cohesiveness, and thickness were reduced significantly (p {\textless} 0.05), while gumminess and chewiness increased (p {\textless} 0.05) considerably with the substitution of TVP (10–40\%) compared to the control. Patties made without TVP received higher scores for sourness, bitterness, umami, and richness than the rest of the formulations. However, a higher tendency was detected for sourness, astringency, umami, and saltiness values with increasing additions of TVP. Nevertheless, hierarchical clustering revealed that the largest group of fatty acid profiles, including palmitoleic acid (C16:1), stearic acid (C18:0), and palmitic acid (C16:0), was slightly reduced with the addition of TVP, while arachidic acid (C20:0), lauric acid (C12:0), and oleic acid (C18:1) increased moderately with increasing levels of TVP. Meanwhile, the second-largest cluster that included linoleic acid (C18:2), arachidonic acid (C20:4), and linolenic acid (C18:3) increased enormously with higher levels of TVP incorporation. Taken together, it is suggested that incorporation of TVP up to 10–40\% in beef patties shows promising results.},

	abstract = {For many ionic polysaccharides, the ability to form gels in the presence of divalent cations such as calcium is the key to biological functions and technological applications. This is particularly true for alginates and pectins, where the regular occurrence of respectively α-l-(1−4)-guluronate residues and α-d-galacturonate residues generates ordered templates for polymer chain associations that are involved in physical gels. The molecular basis responsible for the strength and the stereospecificity of calcium interactions for the two polysaccharides were investigated in a previous paper (Braccini; et al. Carbohydr. Res. 1999, 119). In the present work, a novel molecular modeling procedure has been developed; it involves a pairing procedure that evaluates all the possible associations of the ordered polyuronate chains with calcium ions to form dimers. Starting from the stable ordered forms of polygalacturonate and polyguluronate, all possible ways to form Ca2+-bridged dimers were computed; the parallel and antiparallel relative arrangements of the chains were also considered. Despite the structural analogy between polyguluronate and polygalacturonate chains, significant differences at the level of chain−chain associations are found. The popular “egg box model” can still be referred to in the case of polyguluronate. However, it cannot be used to describe a pectate junction zone as the unique feature of two consecutive chelation site per repeat, that provides a favorable entropic contribution to the interchain association is not reproduced by this pioneering model. The body of these results corroborates the two-stage process in the mechanism of calcium gelation, where the formation of strongly linked dimer associations is followed by the formation of weak inter-dimer associations mainly governed by electrostatic interactions.},

	abstract = {Fucoidans from brown macroalgae (brown seaweeds) have different structures and many interesting bioactivities. Fucoidans are classically extracted from brown seaweeds by hot acidic extraction. Here, we report a new targeted enzyme-assisted methodology for fucoidan extraction from brown seaweeds. This enzyme-assisted extraction protocol involves a one-step combined use of a commercial cellulase preparation (Cellic\&reg;CTec2) and an alginate lyase from Sphingomonas sp. (SALy), reaction at pH 6.0, 40 \&deg;C, removal of non-fucoidan polysaccharides by Ca2+ precipitation, and ethanol-precipitation of crude fucoidan. The workability of this method is demonstrated for fucoidan extraction from Fucus distichus subsp. evanescens (basionym Fucus evanescens) and Saccharina latissima as compared with mild acidic extraction. The crude fucoidans resulting directly from the enzyme-assisted method contained considerable amounts of low molecular weight alginate, but this residual alginate was effectively removed by an additional ion-exchange chromatographic step to yield pure fucoidans (as confirmed by 1H NMR). The fucoidan yields that were obtained by the enzymatic method were comparable to the chemically extracted yields for both F. evanescens and S. latissima, but the molecular sizes of the fucoidans were significantly larger with enzyme-assisted extraction. The molecular weight distribution of the fucoidan fractions was 400 to 800 kDa for F. evanescens and 300 to 800 kDa for S. latissima, whereas the molecular weights of the corresponding chemically extracted fucoidans from these seaweeds were 10\&ndash;100 kDa and 50\&ndash;100 kDa, respectively. Enzyme-assisted extraction represents a new gentle strategy for fucoidan extraction and it provides new opportunities for obtaining high yields of native fucoidan structures from brown macroalgae.},

The complex nature of cell wall polysaccharides limits the extraction of bioactive compounds from these seaweeds. The aim of the study was to use enzyme-assisted extraction as a tool to release the bioactive compounds from seven brown seaweeds of Kuwait coast and characterization of the active extracts. The enzymatic extracts obtained by hydrolysing seaweeds with five carbohydrases and three proteases were screened for antioxidant and antimicrobial activity. Yield, total phenolics, and bioactivity were as a function of species difference in cell wall composition and specificity of the enzyme used. Among the six species of brown seaweeds studied, the enzymatic extracts obtained from Sargassum boveanum, Sargassum angustifolium, and Feldmannia irregularis showed high antioxidant activity in different assays. Though antimicrobial activities of the enzymatic extracts were low, Flavourzyme resulted in more number of seaweed extracts with antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens. In general, carbohydrases resulted in extracts with high radical scavenging activity whereas proteases resulted in extracts with high iron chelating activity. The extracts with highest antioxidant activity such as S. boveanum-Viscozyme and Alcalase extracts were further fractionated and characterized. The polyphenol and polysaccharide-rich fractions were responsible for the high radical scavenging and reducing power whereas the iron chelating activity and inhibition of lipid oxidation in liposome model system was mainly contributed by polysaccharide and protein-rich fractions. The results of study showed that enzyme-assisted extraction could be useful to make tailor-made seaweed extracts with specific bioactivity.},

	abstract = {A growing demand for alternative sources of texturized vegetable protein (TVP) has resulted from various factors including plant allergies, perceived health risks associated with genetically modified organisms (GMO), animal welfare beliefs, and lifestyle choices. Soy and wheat have been the primary ingredients in TVP over the past few decades, but desires for clean label ingredients (especially non-GMO and nonallergenic) have led to demand for alternative plant protein ingredients such as pea protein. To understand the capabilities of pea protein to create meat-like texture with additions of another protein source that also contributes starch, this study focused on extruding pea protein with increasing amounts of chickpea flour (CPF). Six treatments, with inclusions of CPF ranging from 0 to 50\%, were processed on a twin-screw extruder to determine the optimal ratio of pea protein isolate to CPF. Bulk density was the greatest with 20\% CPF (272 g/L) and resulted in the lowest water holding capacity (55.5\%). Texture profile analysis (TPA) hardness, springiness, and chewiness showed optimum results for the 10 and 20\% CPF (674 to 1024 g, 72.1 to 80.7\%, 400 to 439, respectively). With no CPF addition, protein interactions created a strong network exhibiting extreme springiness (91.3\%). Addition of CPF greater than 20\% resulted in a detrimental decrease in hardness by 38 to 84\% and chewiness by 73 to 92\%. Phase transition analysis and specific mechanical energy data provided a greater understanding of the degree of texturization during extrusion. Inclusion of CPF between 10 and 20\% led to the optimum protein to starch ratio, allowing adequate protein texturization and creating product characteristics that could potentially mimic meat. Practical Application Pea protein was mixed with increasing levels of chickpea flour to produce a textured plant protein product using extrusion technology. The ratio of protein to starch can be optimized to target specific textural attributes of textured pea protein to closely mimic different meat products like fish, chicken, or beef. The 10 and 20\% chickpea flour treatments produced the highest quality products according to textural attributes.},

	abstract = {High moisture extrusion (HME) of meat analogues is often performed with raw materials containing multiple components, e.g., blends of different protein-rich raw materials. For instance, blends of soy protein isolate (SPI) and another component, such as wheat gluten, are used particularly frequently. The positive effect of blending on product texture is well known but not yet well understood. Therefore, this work targets investigating the influence of blending in HME at a mechanistic level. For this, SPI and a model protein, whey protein concentrate (WPC), were blended at three different ratios (100:0, 85:15, 70:30) and extruded at typical HME conditions (55\% water content, 115/125/133 °C material temperature). Process conditions, rheological properties, morphology development, product structure and product texture were analysed. With increasing WPC percentage, the anisotropic structures became more pronounced and the anisotropy index (AI) higher. The achieved AI from the extrudates with a ratio of 70:30 (SPI:WPC) were considerably higher than comparable extrudates reported in other studies. In all extrudates, a multiphase system was visible whose morphology had changed due to the WPC addition. The WPC led to the formation of a much smaller dispersed phase compared to the overlying multiphase structure, the size of which depends on the thermomechanical stresses. These findings demonstrate that targeted mixing of protein-rich raw materials could be a promising method to tailor the texture of extruded meat analogues.},

	abstract = {Soy protein, mixed with gluten and starch, was extruded into fibrous meat analogues under high-moisture and high-temperature conditions. The protein solubility of samples collected at different extruder zones and extrudates made with different moistures was determined by 11 extraction solutions consisting of 6 selective reagents and their combinations: phosphate salts, urea, DTT, thiourea, Triton X-100, and CHAPS. Protein solubility by most extractants showed decreasing patterns as the material passed through the extruder, but the solution containing all 6 reagents, known as isoelectric focus (IEF) buffer, solubilized the highest levels and equal amounts of proteins in all samples, indicating that there are no other covalent bonds involved besides disulfide bonds. With regard to relative importance between disulfide bonds and non-covalent interactions, different conclusions could be made from protein solubility patterns, depending on the type of extracting systems and a baseline used for comparison. The observation points out pitfalls and limitation of current protein solubility methodology and explains why controversy exists in the literature. Using the IEF buffer system with omission of one or more selective reagents is considered to be the right methodology to conduct protein solubility study and thus recommended. Results obtained with this system indicate that disulfide bonding plays a more important role than non-covalent bonds in not only holding the rigid structure of extrudates but also forming fibrous texture. The sharpest decrease in protein solubility occurred when the mix passed through the intermediate section of the extruder barrel, indicating formation of new disulfide bonds during the stage of dramatic increase in both temperature and moisture. After this stage, although the physical form of the product might undergo change and fiber formation might occur as it passed through the cooling die, the chemical nature of the product did not change significantly.},

The results showed that 0.1–0.5\% SA of three molecular-weights increased the WHC of myosin-SA gels, and the heavier SA induced a higher WHC. Electrostatic-interactions and hydrogen-bonding contributed to the intermolecular aggregation in the myosin-SA system and enhanced its intermolecular interactions by overcoming the steric hindrance effect of SA with heavier molecules. This aggregation induced the increased turbidity, transition temperature and the decreased surface hydrophobicity of myosin-SA solutions and the formation of an inhomogeneous network with large cavities for entrapping water. The combined effects of stronger intermolecular interactions and the network induced a higher WHC of the gel with heavier SA. It is interesting to understand the gelling mechanism for the protein-polysaccharide system and to efficiently select SA for developing low-fat meat products in industry.},

	abstract = {Of particular interest in this present work is to gain knowledge about the process forming the fibrous structure of peanut protein affected by carrageenan (CA), sodium alginate (SA), and wheat starch (WS), respectively. The multi-scale structure and physicochemical properties of exogenous polysaccharide modified-peanut protein powder (PPP) in the six extrusion zones were widely investigated to explain the process forming a fibrous structure. Results showed that 0.1\% CA could significantly improve the tensile resistant force (about 1.92 kg), but it was not conducive to the fiber orientation. 0.1\% SA could significantly improve the fibrous degree (up to about 1.24), springiness, and the tensile resistant force, but the hardness and chewiness increased significantly. The larger the amount of WS (0–8\%), the lower the fibrous degree was, and the hardness and chewiness were both significantly reduced. Furthermore, 0.1\% CA, 0.1\% SA or 2\% WS can protect the molecular chains of conarachin and arachin from the thermal transition. The selected exogenous polysaccharides, especially the 2\% WS, can promote the aggregation of protein molecules mainly by breaking the intramolecular disulfide bonds, enhancing the hydrophobic interactions and increasing the apparent viscosity to stabilize the newly formed conformation. The protein subunit with a molecular weight of 22 kDa can be largely impacted by the exogenous polysaccharides due to the degradation of the subunits at 42 kDa and 39 kDa. Additionally, 2\% WS can further promote the synthesis of protein subunits with larger molecular weight (66 kDa). The three exogenous polysaccharides can promote the opening of the α-helix and gradually converting into the β-turn and random coil structure. When mixing the PPP with 0.1\% CA, the four protein secondary structures were present with β-sheet {\textgreater} α-helix {\textgreater} β-turn {\textgreater} random coil in the extrudate. While mixing the PPP with 0.1\% SA or 2\% WS, the order was β-sheet {\textgreater} β-turn {\textgreater} α-helix {\textgreater} random coil. This study has provided useful information for producing vegetable protein-based meat substitutes with rich fibrous structure by adding the exogenous polysaccharides.},

	abstract = {Background
Animal-derived protein foods, such as meat, have a large impact on the environment. Meat analogues are products that replace meat in its functionality, i.e. have similar product properties and sensory attributes, which is achieved by the fibrous nature of those products.
Scope and approach
The techniques used to make fibrous products that mimic muscle meats are outlined and categorized based on their approach. The bottom-up approach refers to assembly of structural elements that are combined. The top-down approach refers to structuring of biopolymer blends using an overall force field. The strengths and weaknesses of these approaches are discussed in terms of ingredient and equipment use, (achievable) product resemblance, robustness, scalability, and resource efficiency. To enlarge the theoretical framework, the techniques with the top-down strategy are further contextualized by relating to structure formation processes of materials with other applications, and the methods to analyse the fibrous structures are further outlined.
Key findings and conclusions
Techniques that follow the bottom-up strategy have the potential to resemble the structure of meat most closely, by structuring the proteins hierarchically through assembly of individual structural components. The top-down strategy is better scalable, is more efficient in its use of resources, but can only create the desired structure on larger length scales. Significant progress has been made on the methods to analyse structured products from the last category. Most analysis methods focussed on the (micro)structural anisotropy of the fibrous products, however there is also a need for methods that allow in situ analysis of the evolution of the structure during processing.},

Experimentally, two different dispersed phases were observed in the continuous soy protein matrix; air and pectin. An optimum in shape anisotropy of the air and pectin droplets, and mechanical anisotropy was found for a shear rate of 39 s−1. At higher shear rates, air was expelled and break-up of pectin droplets was found, resulting in materials with hardly any mechanical anisotropy. There was discrepancy between the modeled and experimental data when using the same mass fraction and volume fraction of pectin, whereas the model fitted better when assuming that the pectin phase absorbs more water relatively to the soy phase.},

This SPI-WG blend consists of two phases, which are separated on a micrometer scale. The properties, especially the rheological properties, of SPI- and WG-phases determine the structure formation process largely. The objective of this study was to determine the properties of the phases present in SPI-WG blends using conditions relevant for fibrous structure formation. Since, the rheological properties are dependent on the concentration of each protein in its respective phase, we determined the water content in the two phases with a methodology based on time-domain nuclear magnetic resonance. The spatial distribution of the two phases was studied with confocal scanning laser microscopy, and the rheological properties were measured with three types of oscillatory rheology. The experiments showed that the SPI-phase absorbed more water than the WG-phase, which resulted in a larger volume fraction than mass fraction of the SPI-phase and vice versa for WG. The absorption of more water by SPI resulted in a lower concentration of SPI in that phase, remarkably leading to a G′-value for SPI that was similar to the rheological properties of WG. Similarities in rheological properties seem to be required to strongly deform and align the dispersed phase and form fibrous macrostructures.},

Many vegan products today are made from soy, but drawbacks include the challenges of cultivating soy in colder climates such as northern Europe. Therefore, the present study investigates whether industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa) could substitute soy in the production of high moisture meat analogues (HMMA). A twin screw co-rotating extruder was used to investigate to what extent hemp protein concentrate (HPC) could replace soy protein isolate (SPI) in HMMAs. The substitution levels of HPC were 20 wt\%, 40 wt\% and 60 wt\%. Pasting properties and melting temperature of the protein powders were characterized by Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA) and Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC), respectively and the produced HMMA was analysed by determining the texture and colour attributes. The results showed that it is possible to extrude a mixture with up to 60\% HPC. HPC absorbed less water and needed a higher denaturing temperature compared to SPI. Increasing the moisture content by 5\% would have resulted in a reduction of hardness and chewiness. The lightness (L* value) was found to be significantly higher in SPI product and decreased in the mixture with higher HPC (p \&lt; 0.05).},

	abstract = {Background and objectives The market for plant-based meat alternatives experienced unprecedented growth in the past 3 years bolstered by consumer passion for health and wellness, environmental sustainability, animal welfare, and flexitarian lifestyle. The objective of this review is to summarize the appearance, composition, properties, and plant-based food applications of commercially available textured wheat and textured pea proteins including their blends. This review also covers the chronology of events leading to the development of plant-based meat alternatives, the rationale behind consumer adoption of a plant-based diet, and the different methods of texturizing plant proteins to assume the appearance and texture of real meat. Findings The origin of plant-based meat alternatives can be traced back to the time when hydrated wheat gluten (i.e., seitan) and soy-based tofu were first discovered thousands of years ago. A shift toward the consumption of more plant-based foods for both human and planetary health is generating substantial interest from research scientists, food designers, investors, and consumers. More than a dozen texturization technologies for plant proteins have been employed to create the fibrous structure and fleshy appearance of meat alternative products. Textured wheat and pea proteins with appearance and fibrous structure that mimic those of real meat were developed using low-moisture extrusion technology and formulated in meat alternative products with great success. Both textured proteins are available in several forms differing in size, shape, color, and hydration properties. Shapes can vary from crumbles (granules) to chips (flakes) or shreds of different sizes. They contain 59\%–79\% protein and possess hydration times that decrease with increasing temperature of soaking water with hydration capacities ranging from 1.2 to 4.7 g water absorbed per g of textured protein. Blending of textured wheat protein and textured pea protein improved the in vitro PDCAAS value (0.69–0.74) compared with that of textured wheat protein alone (0.31). Plant-based nuggets, patties, sausages, potstickers, crab cakes, Mexican dishes, and other food products can be successfully formulated that contain either singular or binary mixture of textured protein products to provide texture and nutritional improvements. Conclusions Textured wheat and textured pea proteins including their blends play a significant role in the meat alternative market because they provide resilient meat-like texture, clean flavor profile, a variety of size, shape, and color offerings, ease of formulation, and nutritional benefits (i.e., high protein and no cholesterol). They can be successfully formulated in numerous meat alternative products to provide taste, texture, and nutritional benefits. Significance and novelty This review provides meaningful information on the properties, composition, and food applications of textured wheat and pea proteins including genesis, environmental impact, texturization technologies, and consumer appeal of plant-based meat alternatives. It is projected that meat alternative products will continue to grow driven by increasing consumer demand, the availability of traditional and new plant protein sources, and the application of emerging technologies to transform the plant proteins into a meat-like structure.},

	abstract = {Alginates are produced industrially from marine macroalgae (also called seaweeds) belonging to the taxonomic group of brown algae (phylum Ochrophyta, class Phaeophyceae). In particular, the seaweeds commonly known as kelps (order Laminariales) are the most widely exploited worldwide as raw materials for alginate production. Alginophytes (i.e. alginate-yielding seaweeds) are mainly harvested from wild populations, although some of the raw material that is used in the alginate industry comes from the cultivation of the kelp Saccharina japonica. The demand for alginate production has increased over time, and it is likely to increase significantly in the future, particularly for the use of alginates in current and future biomedical and bioengineering applications. However, alginophyte resources are limited, and the natural kelp resources have declined worldwide in recent years. One way to meet the current and future demands of alginate-using industries is to encourage alginate production via kelp farming. The mariculture of the kelp S. japonica has already been well developed in Asia, and the cultivation of other kelp species is currently also being attempted in Europe and the Americas. This chapter provides an overview of seaweeds as a feedstock for alginate production, with emphasis on kelp farming to ensure a sustainable supply of alginates required for many applications. It describes the major stages for the cultivation of Saccharina and any other kelp, as well as the economic and environmental benefits of integrated kelp aquaculture to produce alginates, in addition to other value-added products.},

The molecular weight (MW) obtained from the viscosity is presented together with the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis required for the determination of the degree of methylation.  The influence of the molecular weight on the main physical properties of methylcellulose in aqueous solution is analyzed. The interfacial properties are examined together with thermogelation. The surface tension and adsorption at interfaces are described: surface tension in aqueous solution is independent of molecular weight but the adsorption at the solid interface depends on the MW, the higher the MW the thicker the polymeric layer adsorbed. The two-step mechanism of gelation is confirmed and it is shown that the elastic moduli of high temperature gels are not dependent on the molecular weight but only on polymer concentration. Finally, the main applications of MC are listed showing the broad range of applications of these water soluble cellulose derivatives.},

The biopolymers were evaluated through solubility, charges, turbidimetry, and optical microscopy analyses; the systems with the pair of biopolymers were analyzed through turbidimetry and optical microscopy. High-methoxyl pectin showed high solubility at all pHs investigated. The soy protein isolate showed low solubility at pH 4.5, which is close to its isoelectric point, and complete solubility at pH 11.0. The formation of complexes suggested an attractive interaction between the biopolymers, with high absorbance reading values and images of complexes from optical microscopy. These complexes were present in systems with pHs below the soy protein isolate's isoelectric point, with positive charges; the high-methoxyl pectin, however, had negative ones.},

Moreover, SH groups and non-covalent interactions of GISG also changed after HUS pre-treatments. The HUS GISG had denser and more uniform microstructures than the untreated GISG. Rheological investments showed that the cooling step (reduce the temperature from 95 to 25°C at a speed of 2°C/min) was more important for the HUS GISG network formation while the heat preservation step (keep temperature at 95 for 20min) was more important for the untreated GISG. HUS reduced the particle size of SPI and Pearson correlation test showed that the particle size of SPI dispersions was negatively correlated with WHC, gel strength and gel firmness.},

Stable multilayer emulsions containing unflocculated alginate/SPI-coated droplets were produced by adding low levels of SPI-stabilized emulsions into alginate solutions at pH 3.0, and emulsion gels prepared from the above emulsions had higher L* values and storage modulus than emulsion gels prepared by adding alginate solutions into SPI-stabilized emulsions. Unstable emulsions containing flocculated droplets were obtained on adding high levels of SPI-stabilized emulsions into alginate solutions or adding alginate solutions into SPI-stabilized emulsions (independent of concentration) at pH 3.0 with mild stirring.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) treatment on SPI and sodium alginate (SA) conjugates prepared through the Maillard reaction. The physicochemical properties of the conjugate synthesized under 200 MPa at 60 °C for 24 h (SPI–SA–200) were compared with those of the conjugate synthesized under atmospheric pressure (SPI–SA–0.1), SPI-SA mixture, and SPI. The HHP (200 MPa) significantly hindered the Maillard reaction. This effect was confirmed by performing SDS-PAGE. The alterations in the secondary structures, such as α-helices, were analyzed using circular dichroism spectroscopy and the fluorescence intensity was determined. Emulsifying activity and stability indices of SPI-SA-200 increased by 33.56\% and 31.96\% respectively in comparison with the SPI–SA–0.1 conjugate. Furthermore, reduced particle sizes (356.18 nm), enhanced zeta potential (‒40.95 mV), and homogeneous droplet sizes were observed for the SPI-SA-200 emulsion. The present study details a practical method to prepare desirable emulsifiers for food processing by controlling the Maillard reaction and improving the functionality of SPI.},

Gel beads were prepared with external gelation by dropping emulsions into CaCl2 solutions using pipettes. The Young's modulus of emulsion gel beads kept increasing during gelation before reaching a plateau accompanied by syneresis (i.e., water loss), shrinkage, and structural tightening. SPI absorbed at the surface of oil droplets could prevent re-coalescence of droplets during gelation. Additionally, increasing concentrations of sodium alginate and oil increased the Young's modulus of gel beads.

Model beverages containing 5\% w/w SPI, 0\% to 0.20\% w/w alginate, and 10\% w/w sucrose were prepared by heating the mixtures at 85 °C for 30 min at pH 6.0 or 7.0. Characterizations of beverages included determination of zeta potential, particle size and rheological properties. Digestion patterns and sucrose release profiles were determined during 2 hr in vitro gastric digestion using SDS-PAGE and HPLC analysis, respectively. Increasing alginate concentration led to increased negative surface charge, particle size, as well as viscosity and pseudoplastic behavior; however, no phase separation was observed. SPI beverages formed intragastric gel during in vitro gastric digestion when the formulations contained alginate or at pH 6.0 without alginate. Formation of the intragastric gel led to delayed protein digestion and release of sucrose. Higher resistance to digestion and a slower sucrose release rate were exhibited at increased alginate concentration, and to a lesser extent, at pH 6.0. This suggests that electrostatic interaction between SPI and alginate that occurred when the beverages were under gastric condition could be responsible for the intragastric gelation. These results could potentially lead to the formulation of SPI beverages with functionality to lower postprandial glycemic response. Practical Application The results could be used to design beverages or semi solid food products with altered digestion properties and lowered or slower glucose release.},

Protein-rich bioresources such as cereals, vegetables, and algae have been explored to mimic animal meat in a similar flavour, texture, sensory and aromatic properties. This review aims to summarize the recent advancements in functional food technology based on vegetal proteins, a comparative account of traditional and commercially available meat alternates. The literature search for the last 10 years shows the rise in research on plant ingredients to develop novel human foods. A brief account of various production methods and their processing effects to improve the structural and techno-functionality of PBMA is suggested for designing sustainable food. The different combinations of plant and animal proteins are discussed to enhance the nutritional aspect, organoleptic profile and shelf-life of available food products. The positive feedback resulted in booming food industries across the world, incorporating vegetal proteins.

The objective of this study was to determine the viscoelastic properties of concentrated SPI-pectin blends under similar conditions as during shear-induced structuring, and after cooling. A closed cavity rheometer was used to measure these properties under these conditions. At 140 °C, SPI and pectin had both a lower G* than the blend of the two and also showed a different behavior in time. Hence, the viscoelastic properties of the blend are richer than those of a simple composite material with stable physical phase properties. In addition, the G′pectin was much lower compared with the G′SPI and G′SPI-pectin upon cooling, confirming that pectin formed a weak dispersed phase. The results can be explained by considering that the viscoelastic properties of the blend are influenced by thermal degradation of the pectin phase. This degradation leads to: i) release of galacturonic acid, ii) lowering of the pH, and iii) water redistribution from the SPI towards the pectin phase. The relative importance of those effects are evaluated.},

Veggie burgers showed levels of energy, fat, and saturate fatty acids (SFA) similar to fish- and poultry-based burgers, but lower than red meat burgers. Compared to conventional burgers, veggie had higher amounts of carbohydrates and sugars and a lower content of proteins, but no difference in salt. Due to the high compositional intra-variability in the veggie burgers, vegetarian and vegan burgers were further analyzed separately. Vegan burgers had higher levels of energy, fat, SFA and protein than vegetarian burgers, but lower carbohydrates and sugars. Once again large differences in the nutritional parameters were observed in both vegan and vegetarian burger categories due to the wide range of ingredients and formulations employed in these types of products. A clear and comprehensive informative labeling is especially needed for vegan and vegetarian burgers to allow the consumer to make a rational decision based on the nutritional facts of these products.},

Severe protein malnutrition, which can cause a fatal outcome, is the leading cause of death for infants and children in many African and Asian countries that have little to no access to complete proteins. Complete proteins, which contain all nine amino acids essential for human health, are usually found in animal-based foods such as meat and dairy products. The overconsumption of animal-based proteins, however, can potentially increase the risk of diet-related chronic diseases. Recent years have witnessed enhanced awareness about the health benefits of substituting animal-based proteins with plant-based proteins, especially in developed countries. Nitrogen-fixing grain legumes are considered important sources of protein in many developing countries because they are generally cheaper than meat or cereals. Extensive research has been conducted on several well-known legumes, notably soybean, which is the most economically important legume worldwide. Nevertheless, many lesser-known legumes with similar nutritional properties to soybean are still underdeveloped, including winged bean, lentil, lima bean, lablab, and bambara groundnut, which are commonly grown in the tropics. Only now are these species receiving more scientific attention. This review highlights the potential of these tropical legumes as future major sources of plant-based proteins, along with the critical research areas for their improvement. We provide insights into how these underutilized legumes could help resolve the global protein crisis and address food insecurity issues.},

In contrast in Western countries beans tend to play only a minor dietary role despite the fact that they are low in fat and are excellent sources of protein, dietary fiber, and a variety of micronutrients and phytochemicals. Soybeans are unique among the legumes because they are a concentrated source of isoflavones. Isoflavones have weak estrogenic properties and the isoflavone genistein influences signal transduction. Soyfoods and isoflavones have received considerable attention for their potential role in preventing and treating cancer and osteoporosis. The low breast cancer mortality rates in Asian countries and the putative antiestrogenic effects of isoflavones have fueled speculation that soyfood intake reduces breast cancer risk. The available epidemiologic data are limited and only weakly supportive of this hypothesis, however, particularly for postmenopausal breast cancer. The data suggesting that soy or isoflavones may reduce the risk of prostate cancer are more encouraging. The weak estrogenic effects of isoflavones and the similarity in chemical structure between soybean isoflavones and the synthetic isoflavone ipriflavone, which was shown to increase bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, suggest that soy or isoflavones may reduce the risk of osteoporosis. Rodent studies tend to support this hypothesis, as do the limited preliminary data from humans. Given the nutrient profile and phytochemical contribution of beans, nutritionists should make a concerted effort to encourage the public to consume more beans in general and more soyfoods in particular.},

	abstract = {Soyfoods have long been prized among vegetarians for both their high protein content and versatility. Soybeans differ markedly in macronutrient content from other legumes, being much higher in fat and protein, and lower in carbohydrate. In recent years however, soyfoods and specific soybean constituents, especially isoflavones, have been the subject of an impressive amount of research. Nearly 2,000 soy-related papers are published annually. This research has focused primarily on the benefits that soyfoods may provide independent of their nutrient content. There is particular interest in the role that soyfoods have in reducing risk of heart disease, osteoporosis and certain forms of cancer. However, the estrogen-like effects of isoflavones observed in animal studies have also raised concerns about potential harmful effects of soyfood consumption. This review addresses questions related to soy and chronic disease risk, provides recommendations for optimal intakes, and discusses potential contraindications. As reviewed, the evidence indicates that, with the exception of those individuals allergic to soy protein, soyfoods can play a beneficial role in the diets of vegetarians. Concerns about adverse effects are not supported by the clinical or epidemiologic literature. Based on the soy intake associated with health benefits in the epidemiologic studies and the benefits noted in clinical trials, optimal adult soy intake would appear to be between two and four servings per day.},

	abstract = {Many protein sources, including soybean meal (SBM), have been investigated as alternatives to fish meal (FM) in aquaculture feeds. However, FM replacement in feeds for carnivorous fishes is limited by problems with feed intake, growth rate, and overall health associated with the reduced digestibility of SBM and the antinutritional factors (ANFs) it contains. Processing strategies can reduce the effects of ANFs and can improve protein utilization. We conducted two trials to examine the possibility of further FM replacement in SBM-maximized feeds for hybrid striped bass (white bass Morone chrysops × striped bass M. saxatilis) by using two refined soy products: soy protein concentrate (SPC) and soy protein isolate (SPI). Diets were formulated to maximize FM replacement, beginning with a basal diet containing 10\% FM and 65\% SBM. Further reductions in FM were made by using SPC or SPI to spare FM-derived protein. Refined soy protein-based feeds were evaluated in feeding trials with juvenile hybrid striped bass that were cultured in recirculating aquaculture systems. Although reducing dietary FM below 10\% by using SPC or SPI resulted in decreased production performance, this appears to be due to a reduction in palatability rather than to negative biological effects (e.g., changes in gut histology, major shifts in carcass proximate composition) associated with ANFs or other dietary effects. A moderate reduction in growth associated with administering the SPC-based feeds corresponded with a moderate reduction in feed intake, whereas dietary inclusion of SPI resulted in severe feeding reluctance, starvation, and cannibalism. Although SPC and SPI may vary in their suitability as FM alternatives, the differential performance observed may also be related to the fact that younger, smaller fish were used in the SPI trial than in the SPC trial. Refined soy proteins can be used in conjunction with SBM to spare FM, but the cost of these products and their acceptability to juvenile carnivorous fish will determine the extent of their utilization in aquafeeds.},

However, it is unclear how unnatural nutritional claims (e.g., artificial ingredients, food additives, genetically modified organisms) affect perceptions of packaged food. Many researchers have cautioned that such labels can be commonly misinterpreted and can further stigmatize food produced by conventional processes. Building on the selective accessibility model, we propose that unnatural nutritional claims on front-of-package food labeling may induce a negative health halo effect. Accessibility of information consistent with a target concept (e.g., a claim on a food label) shapes consumer inferences and evaluations of an associated product (e.g., the packaged food) in the same direction. We propose that such nutritional claims can lead to higher calorie estimates and therefore biased food decisions. Furthermore, we examine the moderating effect of dispositional critical thinking, priming opposing beliefs, and activating causal reasoning to help mitigate on the negative health halo. We test these predictions across five experiments. Together, these findings advance our understanding of the halo effect, inference, and persuasion, and they suggest strategies for helping consumers make more informed health-related judgments and decisions.},

	abstract = {Background
Food naturalness has been the subject of several recent studies and is a key trend in the food industry. There is currently no comprehensive legal definition of food naturalness, which is a multi-faceted and complex principle composed of many aspects. Naturalness-influencing aspects constituting naturalness of food ingredients are similar to those already investigated for finished food products.
Scope and approach
Two research questions are posed in this review: •To what extent are the naturalness criteria for food ingredients set by ISO technical specification 19,657 “Definitions and technical criteria for food ingredients to be considered as natural” in line with the latest trends in consumer studies, reviews and reports on the topic?•What aspects contributing to naturalness of food ingredients are the most present across food ingredients’ categories? The first question is answered through a review of governmental sources and scientific literature related to food naturalness and its evaluation. The second question is addressed through four case studies.
Key findings and conclusions
ISO TS 19657 evaluates food ingredients' naturalness and only partially fulfils consumers’ requests. To build up a more comprehensive evaluation system, other aspects e.g. farming practices should be taken into consideration. The case studies presented in this review paper highlighted this need for a more extended basis for naturalness evaluation of food ingredients. A gap between technical and safety need for processing and consumer perception of processing in relation to naturalness emerged.},

Because the United States government has not set a legal definition for the term \&ldquo;natural\&rdquo;, customers have formed their own sensory perceptions and opinions on what constitutes natural.

Using a national database, 630 consumers were sampled (50\% male and 50\% female) online, and the results were analyzed using percentages and chi-square tests. No ingredient was considered natural by more than 69\% of respondents. We found evidence that familiarity may play a major role in consumers\&rsquo; determination of naturalness. We also found evidence that chemical sounding names and the age of the consumer have an effect on whether an ingredient and potentially a food is considered natural. Interestingly, a preference towards selecting GMO (genetically modified organisms) foods had no significant impact on perceptions of natural.},

Participants (n = 108) were asked to evaluate pictures of different food items containing seaweed (beef burger, cheddar cheese, fettuccine, fish filet, sausage, bread, yogurt, and dried seaweed) using the CATA variant of EsSense25 Profile® and a purchase-intent scale. The consumers also answered questions about their hunger status, food neophobia, food-related lifestyle, as well as open-ended comment questions about seaweed. Participants’ purchase-intent scores were highest for bread and dried seaweed, which they associated with positive emotions. The participants disliked yogurt and sausage, indicating that they were disgusted with them. Participants believed seaweed could be added to fish, savoury, and cereal grains-based foods.

	abstract = {Background
Alternative protein sources are constantly explored to secure the future food and protein demand. Among these sources, biomasses originating from algae, seaweed or leaves receive lots of attention. However, when the yields and purities of protein extracted from these sources are compared to the corresponding data for protein crops such as soy, lupine and pulses, much lower yields are reported for alternative biomasses.
Scope and approach
In this overview paper, we analyse whether this difference is due to lack of scientific insight and technology or that more fundamental reasons are behind the variations in the extraction behaviour. For this purpose, we prepared a description of herbaceous and aquatic biomasses (denoted as green biomass/sources) and their protein extraction practices, final products, and common trends and challenges. The discussion continues with a general comparison to protein crops and the implications for future research.
Key findings and conclusions
Overviewing the state of the art, we tend to conclude that physiological and biochemical factors hinder efficient fractionation of green sources. Such factors include cell architecture and high interconnection between cell components; and biochemical differences, in particular the type of proteins present. These fundamental differences imply that green sources should be explored in a different manner, with higher emphasis on the interesting functional properties of enriched fractions and less on their purity. This approach is further encouraged by highlighting examples where the intricate structures found in green biomass can give rise to positive effects (e.g. health, food structure) when integrally applied in food products.},

	abstract = {The use of plant protein in food products is increasing. Potato protein gelation is scarcely documented, therefore potato protein gel properties were tested for two whole protein isolates (freeze dried or spray dried) and the purified sub-fractions, protease inhibitors and patatins. The effects of protein concentrations, 8 or 15\% (w/w), pH-range of 3.0–7.5, and 2 different levels of ionic strength; low (15 mM NaCl) or high (200 mM NaCl) on heat induced gel properties was studied by oscillatory rheology and by uniaxial compression. Spray drying did not impair gel properties of the whole protein isolates, with the spray dried isolate actually showing higher gel strength at most conditions. For whole protein isolates, gel strength expressed as the storage modulus (G′) had a minimum at pH 4.7 at both high and low salt. The isolated patatin fraction showed a similar trend at low salt, but at high salt the gel strength was very low at pH 3, with progressively higher values at pH 5 and pH 7.5. The protease inhibitor fraction gelled best at low salt and pH values below pH 3.3, while higher pH resulted in very weak gels with a 10-fold decrease in G’. Gel appearance was affected by protein sample, pH, and ionic strength. Both whole protein isolates and the protease inhibitor fraction formed translucent gels at pH 3.0 and ionic strength 15 mM, while patatin formed translucent gels at both pH 3.0 and pH 7.5 at low salt concentration. All other conditions resulted in opaque gels.},

Minced products, like burger patties and nuggets, muscle-type products, like chicken or steak-like cuts, and emulsion products, like Frankfurter and Mortadella type sausages, are the major categories of meat analogues. In this review, we discuss key ingredients for the production of these novel products, with special focus on protein sources, and underline the importance of ingredient functionality. Our observation is that structuring processes are optimized based on ingredients that were not originally designed for meat analogues applications. Therefore, mixing and blending different plant materials to obtain superior functionality is for now the common practice. We observed though that an alternative approach towards the use of ingredients such as flours, is gaining more interest. The emphasis, in this case, is on functionality towards use in meat analogues, rather than classical functionality such as purity and solubility. Another trend is the exploration of novel protein sources such as seaweed, algae and proteins produced via fermentation (cellular agriculture).},

Soya chunks, alfalfa sprouts, and wheat flour were used as base ingredients. Preliminary experimental screening to fix the levels of these base ingredients were the basis to work ahead for formula refining through numerical optimization by way of RSM. The optimization tactics were revealed against a given set of responses viz; physico-chemical (polyphenol, \% crude protein) and sensory properties (mouthfeel and texture, color and appearance and overall acceptability) as dependent variable. Obtained product with (75.35\%) soya, (1.25\%) alfalfa, and (22.73\%) wheat flour were evaluated for their crude protein, fiber, polyphenol, antioxidant level, water holding capacity, hardness, chewiness, and springiness as 26.13, 7.88, 0.52, 7.03, 3.962\%, 1500 g, 2812 g, and 0.60 g, respectively. Practical applications Vegan meat analogue obtained herewith is also competitive in its sensory preferences in alongwith embedded high protein, elevated fiber and antioxidant potential features too. Fortified alfalfa seeds boost it with meaty flavor thus proven to be competitive among commercial demand. Least fat utilization put it in another healthier trait owe to be a better option for obese and calorie conscious patients.

Compression and springiness values also corroborated the same. Sausage samples with xanthan gum were rated as second best after carrageenan samples in terms of textural properties by objective evaluation but subjective evaluation by panelists rated the product as sticky. With carrageenan concentration at 0.8\%, purge loss and cook loss of analogue sausages decreased by 59.63 and 55.55\% respectively, while yield and emulsion stability improved by 37.62 and 67.49\%, respectively, as compared to control. Sausages with SPC and casein were found to be unacceptable by subjective as well as objective evaluation. Practical Applications The concept of utilization of fat replacement additives to improve the quality characteristics of low fat meat sausages has been extended to mushroom based sausage analogues made with added fat. This will lead to development of mushroom based sausages as meat analogues and this study would further open research for utilization of mushrooms and fungal mycelia for meat replacement. Soya has been in use for years as a meat replacer and with studies in this area would open scope for utilization of mushroom for the same purpose and also for new product development from mushrooms.

	abstract = {Calcium addition to soybean protein dispersions increases nutritional value but harms functional properties, such as protein solubility and colloidal stability. The high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) treatment can reverse those effects. The aims of this work were to evaluate the influence of pH and protein and calcium concentration on HHP solubilizing/stabilizing effect and to characterize the physicochemical properties of HHP-stabilized species. Proteins without calcium addition were stabilized by HHP at both pHs. However, calcium-added proteins behaved differentially: at pH 5.9, the effect was verified only at low protein concentration, whereas at pH 7.0, the effect was verified under both assayed protein concentrations (5 and 10 g L−1) and with a higher magnitude in calcium-added samples. Moreover, at pH 7.0, the effect was independent of the order of calcium addition and HHP treatment, whereas at pH 5.9, the effect was smaller when calcium was added after HHP treatment. At both pHs, the solubilizing/stabilizing effect of HHP on soybean proteins seemed to be largely dependent on the decrease in the size of protein species. The smaller the size, the greater the amount of protein that remained in dispersion after intense centrifugation (10,000g, 20 min, 4 °C). Although the effect of HHP consisted, at least in part, of stabilizing insoluble protein, turbidity decreased in all samples after HHP treatment. By combining different levels of pH, calcium, and protein concentrations, translucent or turbid colloidal-stable dispersions can be obtained by HHP treatment.},

	abstract = {Soybean protein isolates (SPI) represent an important source of proteins that are used to prepare oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions. The influence of an innovative treatment (high hydrostatic pressure, HHP) combined with calcium addition at different pH levels and protein concentrations on the formation and stability of o/w SPI emulsions was evaluated in this work. When applied separately, calcium addition or HHP treatment produced different effect at pHs 5.9 and 7.0. Calcium addition led to stable emulsions with decreased flocculation index (FI) at pH 5.9 and low protein concentration (5 g L−1), whereas at pH 7.0, this effect was observed at high protein concentration (10 g L−1). In these conditions, calcium would favor the arrival of big aggregates to interface, which would be modified and adsorbed during homogenization. Treatment with HHP decreased FI and stabilized emulsions during storage at pH 7.0 (but not at pH 5.9) when prepared from 10 g L−1 protein dispersions. In these conditions, protein unfolding due to HHP-induced denaturation, and high ζ-potential would be responsible for emulsion improvement. Combination of calcium addition and HHP treatment impaired both formation and stabilization abilities of SPI at both pHs. Bridging flocculation was enhanced in these samples while interfacial protein concentration and percentage of adsorbed protein were increased. Thus, soybean proteins that were subjected to combined calcium addition and HHP treatment exhibited a great ability to associate each other, what can be useful to improve other functional properties such as gelation.},

The Ca enrichment of protein ingredients during fractionation can provide a new route to increase the Ca content in plant-based products. We, therefore, investigated if the partial replacement of NaOH by Ca(OH)2 during the neutralization step of the fractionation process affects the functional properties of the protein-rich fractions. The protein and oil content of the obtained soy protein-rich fractions (SPFs) were not affected by the use of Ca(OH)2. Moreover, when the Ca content in the SPF was lower than a certain threshold value (6.5 mg Ca/g protein), the functional properties and conformation of SPF did not change significantly. Higher Ca content in the SPF, however, led to protein-rich fractions with larger particle size, higher thermal stability, lower NSI and WHCP values, and weaker gel networks. Thus, any addition of Ca higher than a certain threshold changes the properties of the proteins significantly, which can alter the applicability of the fractions in plant-based food products. Nonetheless, this study showed that with partial replacement of NaOH by Ca(OH)2, the enrichment of SPF with Ca is possible without strongly influencing the SPF properties.},

	abstract = {Several applications of protein hydrolysates have been documented including gelation, solubility and emulsifying properties. However, very rare reviews have solely explored the potentials of soy protein hydrolysates (SPHs). Varying and abundant pieces of information on the physicochemical properties of soy proteins, such as foaming, solubility, emulsifying, gelling, fat- and water-holding capacities, suggest their hydrolysates to be equally or more important. In this regard, this review highlights the different methods that have been used to prepare SPHs, coupled with the most promising applications and potentials of SPHs. Nonetheless, further investigations are necessary to validate the potentialities of SPHs as food agents for the emerging functional foods.},

	abstract = {The objective of this research is to investigate the effect of soluble soybean polysaccharide (SSPS) on properties of pea protein isolate (PPI) with the processing of freeze-drying. First, PPI-SSPS complex was fabricated under the condition of pH 2.5 via electrostatic interaction. Then, PPI-SSPS complex with different mass ratio of PPI and SSPS was processed with freeze-drying. By freeze-drying treatment, the structural part of the PPI particles was unfolded, resulting in improvement of surface hydrophobicity and foamability. Since SSPS adhered to PPI through hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding, the surface hydrophobicity of the reconstituted PPI particles was reduced, meanwhile the emulsion stability was enhanced. The addition of SSPS leaded to rearrange and interconnect of the modified particles, resulting in improvement of interfacial properties and rheological properties. These results indicated that modified PPI-SSPS complex, as compared to the native PPI, exhibited a greater potential to act as a kind of excellent surface-active substance.},

	abstract = {Pea and rice proteins are promising to substitute allergenic proteins, and increasingly, play important roles in the food industry because of their hypoallergenic characteristics and nutritional value. However, manufacturers generally provide limited functionality information on these proteins. Therefore, this study comprehensively compared functional properties of wheat, soybean, rice, and pea proteins for their industrial applications and illustrated correlation among various functionalities. Results showed that protein solubility (PS) was highly related to its water absorption (WA) capacity, emulsifying activity index (EAI), and emulsion stability index (ESI). The overall functionality of pea protein was close to that of soybean protein while rice protein cannot match with all other proteins. sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS‐PAGE) analysis indicated the composition of each protein was unique. While the deconvolution of the amide I band of the Raman spectra indicated soybean and pea proteins that shared similar features, but they were different from that of wheat and rice proteins. Practical applications: Due to the allergenicity of wheat and soybean proteins, food manufacturers are looking for alternative protein sources. Rice and Pea proteins are promising substitutes because of their "allergen‐friendly" as well as their emergence in the food market. This study provided a comprehensive comparison of the functionality of commercially available wheat, soybean, rice, and pea proteins. The information presented in this study would be helpful to food scientists, scholars, or engineers when they develop appropriate application of various proteins in food products.},

	abstract = {In this study an alternative mild fractionation process for the extraction of soy protein is investigated; aqueous fractionation, in which oil extraction and intensive washing steps are omitted. Moreover, a pH adjustment is proposed instead of the conventional neutralization step. The mildly fractionated soy protein fractions (SPFs) showed higher protein and oil content compared to commercial soy protein isolate. The process retained the proteins’ native state. SPFs adjusted at pH 4.5 and 5.5 (close to pI) formed a powdery texture, resulting in larger size particles after dispersion in water. Despite their low nitrogen solubility index, water holding capacity and viscosity, when mixed with flour these SPFs presented the highest G* values. A flaky texture and reversed properties were observed with SPF adjusted at pH away from the pI. The range of properties achieved exhibits new routes in creating soy protein ingredients with desired functionality, avoiding over-processing due to post-treatment modifications.},
