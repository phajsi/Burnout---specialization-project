	abstract = {Objective
Being a healthcare professional can be a uniquely rewarding calling. However, the demands of training and practice can lead to chronic distress and serious psychological, interpersonal and personal-health burdens. Although higher burnout, depression and suicide rates have been reported in healthcare professionals, only a minority receives treatment. Concerns regarding confidentiality, stigma, potential career implications, and cost and time constraints are cited as key barriers. Web-based and mobile applications have been shown to mitigate stress, burnout, depression, and suicidal ideation among several populations and may circumvent these barriers. Here, we reviewed published data on such resources and selected a small sample that readily can be used by healthcare providers.

Methods
We searched PubMed for articles evaluating stress, burnout, depression and suicide prevention or intervention for healthcare students or providers and identified 5 categories of programs with significant effectiveness: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (online), meditation, mindfulness, breathing, and relaxation techniques. Using these categories, we searched for stress-, burnout-, depression-, and suicide prevention- web-based (through Google and beacon.anu.edu.au--a wellness resource website) and mobile applications (Apple and mobile.va.gov/appstore) and identified 36 resources to further evaluate based on relevance, applicability to healthcare providers (confidentiality, convenience and cost) and the strength of findings supporting their effectiveness.

Results
We selected 7 resources under 5 general categories designed to foster wellness and reduce burnout, depression, and suicide risk among healthcare workers: breathing (Breath2Relax), meditation (Headspace, guided meditation audios), web-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MoodGYM, Stress Gym) and suicide prevention apps (Stay Alive, Virtual Hope Box).

Conclusions
This list serves as a starting point to enhance coping with stressors as a healthcare student or professional in order to help mitigate burnout, depression and suicidality. Next steps include adapting digital health strategies to specifically fit the needs of healthcare providers, with the ultimate goal of facilitating in-person care when warranted.},

A historical review of the development of this concept, in terms of theoretical models and assessment tools, points to the tension between models of greater complexity and efforts to achieve greater simplicity. An overview of empirical findings reveals the importance of chronic stressors in the job environment, as well as costly personal and organizational outcomes. Furthermore, there is a significant theme in the burnout experience, of imbalance between demands and resources, and between the job and the individual worker.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.burn.2015.05.001},
	abstract = {Background/aim
Occupational health largely depends on the perceived fit between the employee's abilities and workplace demands/factors. The Areas of Worklife Scale (AWS) specifies six areas that are particularly relevant in this respect: workload, control, reward, community, fairness, and values. The current article aimed at investigating the factorial structure and the criterion validity of the German translation of the AWS.
Methods
Data were collected in two samples. In study 1, 1455 public service workers were surveyed using the six areas of worklife and well-being. In study 2, to investigate the well-established relationship between the AWS and burnout, the scale was administered to a nursing sample (N=443).
Results
High internal consistencies for all six scales were obtained in both studies. Exploratory as well as confirmatory factor analysis replicated the theoretically assumed six scale structure of the AWS. Evidence of criterion validity was found by multiple linear regression analysis with well-being as dependent measure (study 1). SEM analyses supported the hypothesized relationships between the six AWS dimensions and burnout (study 2). As predicted by Leiter and Maslach, 2004, Leiter and Maslach, 2009, only some areas were directly associated with the health-related outcomes (well-being and burnout). In line with previous work, workload and values proved to be the most critical areas of worklife.
Conclusions
The six areas of worklife have been shown to be significant predictors of health-related outcomes. Based on the current studies, the German translation of the AWS can be proposed as a reliable and valid instrument to identify and specify critical work-related areas for occupational health.},
